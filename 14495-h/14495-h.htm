<p><tt><a name="intro">INTRODUCTION</a><br>
<br>
Recent students of criticism have usually placed Rapin in the
School of Sense. In fact Rapin clearly denominates himself a member
of that school. In the introduction to his major critical work,
<u>Reflexions sur la Poetique d'Aristote</u> (1674), he states that
his essay "is nothing else, but Nature put in Method, and good
<u>Sense</u> reduced to Principles" (<u>Reflections on Aristotle's
Treatise of Poesie</u>, London, 1731, II, 131). And in a few
passages as early as "A Treatise de Carmine Pastorali" (1659), he
seems to imply that he is being guided in part at least by the
criterion of "good <u>Sense</u>." For example, after citing several
writers to prove that "brevity" is one of the "graces" of pastoral
poetry, he concludes, "I could heap up a great many more things to
this purpose, but I see no need of such a trouble, since no man can
rationally doubt of the goodness of my Observation" (p.41).<br>
<br>
The basic criterion, nevertheless, which Rapin uses in the
"Treatise" is the authority of the Ancients—the poems of Theocritus
and Virgil and the criticism of Aristotle and Horace. Because of his
constant references to the Ancients, one is likely to conclude that
he (like Boileau and Pope) must have thought they and Nature (good
sense) were the same. In a number of passages, however, Rapin
depends solely on the Ancients. Two examples will suffice to
illustrate his absolutism. At the beginning of "<u>The Second</u>
Part," when he is inquiring "into the nature of <u>Pastoral,</u>"
he admits:</tt>

<blockquote><tt>And this must needs be a hard Task, since I have no
guide, neither <u>Aristotle</u> nor <u>Horace</u> to direct me....
And I am of opinion that none can treat well and clearly of any
kind of <u>Poetry</u> if he hath no helps from these two (p. 16).</tt>
</blockquote>

<tt>In "<u>The Third</u> Part," when he begins to "lay down" his
<u>Rules for writing</u> Pastorals," he declares:</tt>

<blockquote><tt><span class = "pagenum">ii</span>Yet in this difficulty
I will follow <u>Aristotle</u>'s Example, who being to lay down
Rules concerning <u>Epicks</u>, propos'd <u>Homer</u> as a Pattern,
from whom he deduc'd the whole Art; So I will gather from
<u>Theocritus</u> and <u>Virgil</u>, those Fathers of
<u>Pastoral</u>, what I shall deliver on this account (p.
52).</tt></blockquote>

<tt>These passages represent the apogee of the neoclassical criticism of
pastoral poetry. No other critic who wrote on the pastoral depends
so completely on the authority of the classical critics and poets.
As a matter of fact, Rapin himself is not so absolute later. In the
section of the <u>Réflexions</u> on the pastoral, he merely states
that the best models are Theocritus and Virgil. In short, one may
say that in the "Treatise" the influence of the Ancients is
dominant; in the <u>Réflexions</u>, "good <u>Sense</u>."<br>
<br>
Reduced to its simplest terms, Rapin's theory is Virgilian. When
deducing his theory from the works of Theocritus and Virgil, his
preference is almost without exception for Virgil. Finding Virgil's
eclogues refined and elegant, Rapin, with a suggestion from Donatus
(p. 10 and p. 14), concludes that the pastoral "belongs properly to
the <u>Golden Age</u>" (p. 37)—"that blessed time, when Sincerity
and Innocence, Peace, Ease, and Plenty inhabited the Plains" (p. 5).
Here, then, is the immediate source of the Golden Age eclogue,
which, being transferred to England and popularised by Pope,
flourished until the time of Dr. Johnson and Joseph Warton.<br>
<br>
In France the most prominent opponent to the theory formulated by
Rapin is Fontenelle. In his "Discours sur la Nature de l'Eglogue"
(1688) Fontenelle, with studied and impertinent disregard for the
Ancients and for "ceux qui professent cette espèce de religion que
l'on s'est faite d'adorer l'antiquité," expressly states that the
basic criterion by which he worked was "les lumières naturelles de
la raison" (<u>OEuvres</u>, Paris, 1790, V, 36). It is careless and
incorrect to imply that Rapin's and Fontenelle's theories of
pastoral poetry are similar, as Pope, Joseph Warton, and many other
critics and scholars have<span class = "pagenum">iii</span> done.
Judged by basic critical principles, method, or content there is a
distinct difference between Rapin and Fontenelle. Rapin is primarily
a neoclassicist in his "Treatise"; Fontenelle, a rationalist in his
"Discours." It is this opposition, then, of neoclassicism and
rationalism, that constitutes the basic issue of pastoral criticism
in England during the Restoration and the early part of the
eighteenth century.<br>
<br>
When Fontenelle's "Discours" was translated in 1695, the first
phrase of it quoted above was translated as "those Pedants who
profess a kind of Religion which consists of worshipping the
Ancients" (p. 294). Fontenelle's phrase more nearly than that of the
English translator describes Rapin. Though Rapin's erudition was
great, he escaped the quagmire of pedantry. He refers most
frequently to the scholiasts and editors in "<u>The First Part</u>"
(which is so trivial that one wonders why he ever troubled to
accumulate so much insignificant material), but after quoting them
he does not hesitate to call their ideas "pedantial" (p. 24) and to
refer to their statements as grammarian's "prattle" (p. 11). And,
though at times it seems that his curiosity and industry impaired
his judgment, Rapin does draw significant ideas from such scholars
and critics as Quintilian, Vives, Scaliger, Donatus, Vossius,
Servius, Minturno, Heinsius, and Salmasius.<br>
<br>
Rapin's most prominent disciple in England is Pope. Actually, Pope
presents no significant idea on this subject that is foreign to
Rapin, and much of the language—terminology and set phrases—of
Pope's "Discourse" comes directly from Rapin's "Treatise" and from
the section on the pastoral in the <u>Reflections</u>. Contrary to
his own statement that he "reconciled" some points on which the
critics disagree and in spite of the fact that he quotes Fontenelle,
Pope in his "Discourse" is a neoclassicist almost as thoroughgoing
as Rapin. <span class = "pagenum">iv</span>The ideas which he says
he took from Fontenelle are either unimportant or may be found in
Rapin. Pope ends his "Discourse" by drawing a general conclusion
concerning his <u>Pastorals</u>: "But after all, if they have any
merit, it is to be attributed to some good old authors, whose works
as I had leisure to study, so I have not wanted care to imitate."
This statement is diametrically opposed to the basic ideas and
methods of Fontenelle, but in full accord with and no doubt directly
indebted to those of Rapin.<br>
<br>
The same year, 1717, that Pope 'imitated' Rapin's "Treatise," Thomas
Purney made a direct attack on Rapin's neoclassic procedure. In the
"Preface" to his own <u>Pastorals</u> he expresses his disapproval
of Rapin's method, evidently with the second passage from Rapin
quoted above in mind:</tt>

<blockquote><tt><u>Rapine's</u> Discourse is counted the best on this
Poem, for 'tis the longest. You will easily excuse my not mentioning
all his Defects and Errors in this Preface. I shall only say then,
that instead of looking into the true Nature of the Pastoral Poem,
and then judging whether <u>Theocritus</u> or any of his Followers
have brought it to it's utmost Perfection or not. <u>Rapine</u>
takes it for granted that <u>Theocritus</u> and <u>Virgil</u> are
infallible; and aim's at nothing beyond showing the Rules which he
thinks they observ'd. Facetious Head! (<u>Works</u>, Oxford, 1933,
pp. 51-52. The Peroy Reprints, No. XII)</tt></blockquote>

<tt>The influence of Rapin on the development of the pastoral,
nevertheless, was salutary. Finding the genre vitiated with wit,
extravagance, and artificiality, he attempted to strip it of these
Renaissance excrescencies and restore it to its pristine purity by
direct reference to the Ancients—Virgil, in particular. Though
Rapin does not have the psychological insight into the esthetic
principles of the genre equal to that recently exhibited by William
Empson or even to that expressed by Fontenelle, he does understand
the intrinsic appeal of the pastoral which has enabled it to
survive, and often to flourish, through the centuries in painting,
music, and<span class = "pagenum">v</span> poetry. Perhaps his most
explicit expression of this appreciation is made while he is
discussing Horace's statement that the muses love the country:</tt>
<blockquote>
<tt>And to speak from the very bottome of my heart... methinks he is
much more happy in a Wood, that at ease contemplates this universe,
as his own, and in it, the Sun and Stars, the pleasing Meadows,
shady Groves, green Banks, stately Trees, flowing Springs, and the
wanton windings of a River, fit objects for quiet innocence, than he
that with Fire and Sword disturbs the World, and measures his
possessions by the wast that lys about him (p. 4).</tt></blockquote>
<br>
<tt>René Rapin (1621-1687), in spite of his duties as a Jesuit priest
and disputes with the Jansenists, became one of the most widely read
men of his time and carried on the celebrated discussions about the
Ancients with Maimbourg and Vavasseur. His <u>chef-d'oeuvre</u>
without contradiction is <u>Hortorum libri IV</u>. Like Virgil,
Spenser, Pope, and many aspiring lesser poets, he began his literary
career by writing pastorals, <u>Eclogae Sacrae</u> (1659), to which
is prefixed in Latin the original of "A Treatise de Carmine
Pastorali."<br>

<p><span class = "firstletter">T</span>O be as short as possible in
my discourse upon the present Subject, I shall not touch upon the
Excellency of <i>Poetry</i> in general; nor repeat those high
<i>Encomiums</i>, (as that tis the most divine of all human Arts,
and the like) which <i>Plato</i> in his <i>Jone</i>,
<i>Aristotele</i>
in his <i>Poetica</i>, and other Learned men have copiously insisted
on: And this I do that I might more closely and briefly pursue my
present design, which, no doubt will not please every man; for since
I treat of that part of <i>Poetry</i>, which (to use
<i>Quintilian’s</i> words,) by reason of its Clownishness, is
affraid of the Court and City; some may imagine that I follow
<i>Nichocaris</i> his humor, who would paint only the most ugly and
deform’d, and those too in the meanest and most frightful dress,
that real, or fancy’d Poverty could put them in.</p>

<p><span class = "pagenum">2</span>For some think that to be a
Sheapard is in it self mean, base, and sordid; And this I think is
the first thing that the graver and soberer sort will be ready to
object.</p>

<p>But if we consider how honorable that employment is, our
Objectors from that Topick will be easily answer’d, for as
<i>Heroick</i> Poems owe their dignity to the Quality of
<i>Heroes</i>, so <i>Pastorals</i> to that of <i>Sheapards</i>.</p>

<p>Now to manifest this, I shall not rely on the authority of the
<i>Fabulous</i>, and <i>Heroick</i> Ages, tho, in the former, a God
fed Sheep in <i>Thessaly</i>, and in the latter, <i>Hercules</i>
the Prince of <i>Heroes</i>, (as <i>Paterculus</i> stiles him)
graz’d on mount <i>Aventine</i>: These Examples, tis true, are not
convinceing, yet they sufficiently shew that the employment of a
Sheapard was sometime look’d upon to be such, as in those Fabulous
times was not alltogether unbecomeing the <i>Dignity</i> of a
<i>Heroe</i>, or the <i>Divinity</i> of a <i>God</i>: which
consideration if it cannot be of force enough to procure excellence,
yet certainly it may secure it from the imputation of baseness,
since it was sometime lookt upon as fit for the greatest in Earth
or Heaven.</p>

<p>But not to insist on the authority of <i>Poets</i>, <i>Sacred
Writt</i> tells us that <i>Jacob</i> and <i>Esau</i>, two great men,
were Sheapards; And <i>Amos</i>, one of the Royal Family, asserts
the same of himself, for <i>He was</i> among <i>the Sheapards of
Tecua</i>, following that employment: The like by Gods own
appoint<span class = "pagenum">3</span>ment prepared <i>Moses</i>
for a Scepter, as <i>Philo</i> intimates in his life, when He tells
us, <i>that a Sheapards Art is a suitable preparation to a
Kingdome</i>; the same He mentions in the Life of <i>Joseph</i>,
affirming that the care a Sheapard hath over his Cattle, very much
resembles that which a King hath over his Subjects: The same
<i>Basil</i> in his Homily de <i>S. Mamm. Martyre</i> hath
concerning <i>David</i>, who was taken from following the Ews great
with young ones to feed <i>Israel</i>, for He says that the Art of
feeding and governing are very near akin, and even Sisters: And
upon this account I suppose twas, that Kings amongst the
<i>Greeks</i> reckoned the name of Sheapard one of their greatest
titles, for, if we believe <i>Varro</i>, amongst the Antients, the
best and bravest was still a Sheapard: Every body knows that the
<i>Romans</i> the worthiest and greatest Nation in the World sprang
from <i>Sheapards</i>: The Augury of the Twelve Vulturs plac’t a
Scepter in <i>Romulus</i>’s hand which held a Crook before; and at
that time, as <i>Ovid</i> says,</p>

<div class = "verse"><i>His own small Flock each Senator did keep.</i></div>

<p><i>Lucretius</i> mentions an extraordinary happiness, and as it
were Divinity in a <i>Sheaperd’s</i> life,</p>

<div class = "verse"><i>Thro Sheapards ease, and their Divine retreats.</i></div>

<p>And this is the reason, I suppose, why the solitude of the
Country, the shady Groves, and security of that happy Quiet was so
grateful to the Muses, for thus <i>Horace</i> represents them,
</p>
<span class = "pagenum">4</span>
<div class = "verse"><i>The Muses that the Country Love</i>.</div>

<p>Which Observation was first made by <i>Mnasalce</i> the <i>Sicyonian</i> in his Epigram upon <i>Venus</i></p>

<div class = "verse"><i>The Rural Muse upon the Mountains feeds</i>.</div>

<p>For sometimes the Country is so raveshing and delightful, that
twill raise Wit and Spirit even in the dullest Clod, And in truth,
amongst so many heats of Lust and Ambition which usually fire our
Citys, I cannot see what retreat, what comfort is left for a chast
and sober Muse.</p>

<p>And to speak from the very bottome of my heart, (not to mention
the integrity and innocence of Sheapards upon which so many have
insisted, and so copiously declaimed) methinks he is much more happy
in a Wood, that at ease contemplates this universe, as his own, and
in it, the Sun and Stars, the pleasing Meadows, shady Groves, green
Banks, stately Trees, flowing Springs, and the wanton windings of a
River, fit objects for quiet innocence, than he that with Fire and
Sword disturbs the World, and measures his possessions by the wast
that lys about him: <i>Augustus</i> in the remotest East fights for
peace, but how tedious were his Voyages? how troublesome his
Marches? how great his disquiets? what fears and hopes distracted
his designs? whilst <i>Tityrus</i> contented with a little, happy
in the enjoyment of his Love, and at ease under his spreading
Beech.</p>

<div class = "verse"><i>Taught Trees to sound his</i> Amaryllis <i>name</i>.</div>

<p><span class = "pagenum">5</span>
On the one side <i>Melibœus</i> is forc’t to leave his Country, and
<i>Antony</i> on the other; the one a Sheapard, the other a great
man, in the Common-Wealth; how disagreeable was the Event? the
Sheapard could endure himself; and sit down contentedly under his
misfortunes, whilst lost <i>Antony</i>,unable to hold out, and
quitting all hopes both for himself and his Queen, became his own
barbarous Executioner: Than which sad and deplorable fall I cannot
imagine what could be worse, for certainly nothing is so miserable
as a Wretch made so from a flowrishing &amp; happy man; by which tis
evident how much we ought to prefer before the gaity of a great and
shining State, that Idol of the Crowd, the lowly simplicity of a
Sheapards Life: for what is that but a perfect image of the state
of Innocence, of that golden Age, that blessed time, when Sincerity
and Innocence, Peace, Ease, and Plenty inhabited the Plains?</p>

<p>Take the Poets description</p>

<div class = "verse"><i>Here Lowly Innocence makes a sure retreat,<br>
A harmless Life, and ignorant of deceit,<br>
and free from fears with various sweet’s encrease,<br>
And all’s or’e spread with the soft wings of Peace:<br>
Here Oxen low, here Grots, and purling Streams,<br>
And Spreading shades invite to easy dreams.</i></div>

<p>And thus <i>Horace</i>,</p>

<div class = "verse"><i>Happy the man beyond pretence<br>
Such was the state of Innocence, &amp;c.</i></div>

<p><span class = "pagenum">6</span>
And from this head I think the dignity of <i>Bucolicks</i> is
sufficiently cleared, for as much as the Golden Age is to be
preferred before the <i>Heroick</i>, so much <i>Pastorals</i> must
excell <i>Heroick</i> Poems: yet this is so to be understood, that
if we look upon the majesty and loftiness of <i>Heroick</i> Poems,
it must be confest that they justly claim the preheminence; but if
the unaffected neatness, elegant, graceful smartness of the
expression, or the polite dress of a Poem be considered, then they
fall short of <i>Pastorals</i>: for this sort flows with Sweet,
Elegant, neat and pleasing fancies; as is too evident to every one
that hath tasted the sweeter muses, to need a farther explication:
for tis not probable that <i>Asinius Pollio</i>, <i>Cinna</i>,
<i>Varius</i>, <i>Cornelius Gallus</i>, men of the neatest Wit, and
that lived in the most polite Age, or that <i>Augustus Cæsar</i>
the Prince of the <i>Roman</i> elegance, as well as of the common
Wealth, should be so extreamly taken with <i>Virgils Bucolicks</i>,
or that <i>Virgil</i> himself a man of such singular prudence, and
so correct a judgment, should dedicate his Eclogues to those great
Persons; unless he had known that there is somewhat more then
ordinary Elegance in those sort of Composures, which the wise
perceive, tho far above the understanding of the Crowd: nay if
<i>Ludovicus Vives</i>, a very learned man, and admired for politer
studies may be believed, there is somewhat more sublime and
excellent in those <i>Pastorals</i>, than the Common
<span class = "pagenum">7</span> sort of Grammarians imagine: This
I shall discourse of in an other place, and now inquire into the
Antiquity of Pastorals.</p>

<div class = "sidenote"><i>The Antiquity of Pastorals</i>.</div>

<p>Since <i>Linus</i>, <i>Orpheus</i>, and <i>Eumolpus</i> were
famous for their Poems, before the <i>Trojan</i> wars; those are
certainly mistaken, who date Poetry from that time; I rather incline
to their opinion who make it as old as the World it self; which
Assertion as it ought to be understood of Poetry in general, so
especially of <i>Pastoral</i>, which, as <i>Scaliger</i> delivers,
was the most antient kind of Poetry, and resulting from the most
<i>antient</i> way of Liveing: <i>Singing first began amongst
Sheapards as they fed their Flocks, either by the impulse of nature,
or in imitation of the notes of Birds, or the whispering of
Trees.</i></p>

<p>For since the first men were either <i>Sheapards</i> or
<i>Ploughmen</i>, and <i>Sheapards</i>, as may be gathered out of
<i>Thucydides</i> and <i>Varro</i>, were before the others, they
were the first that either invited by their leisure, or (which
<i>Lucretius</i> thinks more probable) in imitation of Birds, began
a tune.</p>

<div class = "verse"><i>Thro all the Woods they heard the pleasing noise<br>
Of chirping Birds, and try’d to frame their voice,<br>
And Imitate, thus Birds instructed man,<br>
And taught them Songs before their Art began.</i></div>

<p>In short, tis so certain that Verses first began in the Country
that the thing is in it self evident, and this <i>Tibullus</i> very
plainly signifies,
</p>
<span class = "pagenum">8</span>
<div class = "verse"><i>First weary at his Plough the labouring Hind<br>
In certain feet his rustick words did bind:<br>
His dry reed first he tun’d at sacred feasts<br>
To thanks the bounteous Gods, and cheer his Guests.</i></div>

<p><i>In certain feet</i> according to <i>Bern Cylenius</i> of
<i>Verona</i> his interpretation <i>in set measures</i>: for
<i>Censorinus</i> tells us, that the antient Songs were loose and
not ty’d up to any strict numbers, and afterwards by certain laws
and acknowledged rules were confin’d to such and such measures: for
this is the method of Nature in all her works, from imperfect and
rude beginnings things take their first rise, and afterwards by fit
and apposite additions are polish’t, and brought to perfection: such
were the Verses which heretofore the <i>Italian</i> Sheapards and
Plough-men, as <i>Virgil</i> says, sported amongst themselves.</p>

<div class = "verse"><i>Italian Plough-men sprung from antient</i> Troy<br>

that Sheapards were first taught by the rushing of soft Breezes
amongst the Canes to blow their Reeds, and so by degrees to put
their Songs in tune. </p>

<div class = "verse"><i>For Whilst soft Evening Gales blew or’e the Plains<br>
And shook the sounding Reeds, they taught the Swains,<br>
And thus the Pipe was fram’d, and tuneful Reed,<br>
And whilst the Flocks did then securely feed,<br>
The harmless Sheapards tun’d their Pipes to Love,<br>
And Amaryllis name fill’d every Grove.</i></div>
<span class = "pagenum">9</span>

<p>From all which tis very plain that <i>Poetry</i> began in those
days, when Sheapards took up their employment: to this agrees
<i>Donatus</i> in his Life of <i>Virgil</i>, and <i>Pontanus</i> in
his Fifth Book of Stars, as appears by these Verses.</p>

<div class = "verse"><i>Here underneath a shade by purling Springs<br>
The Sheapards Dance, whilst sweet</i> Amyntas <i>sings;<br>
Thus first the new found Pipe was tun’d to Love,<br>
And Plough-men taught their Sweet hearts to the Grove,</i></div>

<p>Thus the <i>Fescennine</i> jests when they sang harvest-home,
and then too the Grape gatherers and Reapers Songs began, an elegant
example of which we have in the Tenth <i>Idyllium</i> of
<i>Theocritus</i>.</p>

<p>From this birth, as it were, of <i>Poetry</i>, Verse began to
grow up to greater matters; For from the common discourse of
<i>Plough-men</i> and <i>Sheapards</i>, first <i>Comedy</i>, that
Mistress of a private Life, next <i>Tragedy</i>, and then <i>Epick
Poetry</i> which is lofty and <i>Heroical</i> arrose, This
<i>Maximus Tyrius</i> confirms in his Twenty first
<ins class = "correction" title = "text reads
’dissetation'">dissertation</ins>,
where he tells us that Plough-men just comeing from their work, and
scarce cleansed from the filth of their employment, did use to flurt
out some sudden and <i>extempore</i> Catches; and from this
beginning Plays were produc’d and the Stage erected: Thus
<span class = "pagenum">10</span> much concerning the
<i>Antiquity</i>, next of the <i>Original</i> of this sort.</p>

<p>About this Learned men cannot agree, for who was the first
Author, is not sufficiently understood; <i>Donatus</i>, tis true,
tells us tis proper to the Golden Age, and therefore must needs be
the product of that happy time: but who was the Author, where, what
time it was first invented hath been a great Controversy, and not
yet sufficiently determined: <i>Epicharmus</i> one of
<i>Pythagoras</i> his School, in his <span class = "greek">ἀλκύονι</span>
mentions one <i>Diomus</i> a <i>Sicilian</i>, who, if we believe
<i>Athænæus</i> was the first that wrote <i>Pastorals: those that
fed Cattle had a peculiar kind of Poetry, call’d Bucolicks,
of which Dotimus a Sicilian was inventer:</i></p>

<p><i>Diodorus Siculus</i> <span class = "greek">ἐν τοῖς
μυθολογουμένοις</span>, seems to make <i>Daphnis</i> the son of
<i>Mercury</i> and a certain <i>Nymph</i>, to be the Author; and
agreeable to this, <i>Theon</i> an old <i>scholiast</i> on
<i>Theocritus</i>, in his notes upon the first <i>Idyllium</i>
mentioning <i>Daphnis</i>, adds, <i>he was the author of
Bucolicks</i>, and <i>Theocritus himself</i> calls him <i>the Muses
Darling</i>: and to this Opinion of <i>Diodorus Siculus Polydore
Virgil</i> readily assents.</p>

<p>But <i>Mnaseas</i> of <i>Patara</i> in a discourse of his
concerning <i>Europa</i>, speaks thus of a Son of <i>Pan</i> the God
of Sheapards: <i>Panis Filium Bubulcum à quo &amp; Bucolice canere:</i>
Now Whether <i>Mnaseas</i> by that <i>Bubulcum</i>, means only a
<i>Herds-man</i>, or one skilled in <i>Bucolicks</i>, is uncertain;
but if <i>Valla’s</i> <span class = "pagenum">11</span> judgment be
good, tis to be taken of the latter: yet <i>Ælian</i> was of another
mind, for he boldly affirms that <i>Stesichorus</i> called
<i>Himeræus</i> was the first, and in the same place adds, that
<i>Daphnis</i> the Son of <i>Mercury</i> was the first Subject of
<i>Bucolicks</i>.</p>

<p>Some ascribe the Honor to <i>Bacchus</i> the President of the
<i>Nymphs, Satyrs</i>, and the other Country Gods, perhaps because
he delighted in the Country; and others attribute it to
<i>Apollo</i> called <i>Nomius</i> the God of Sheapards, and that he
invented it then when he served <i>Admetus</i> in <i>Thessaly</i>,
and fed his Herds: For, tis likely, he to recreate himself, and pass
away his time, applied his mind to such Songs as were best suitable
to his present condition: Many think we owe it to <i>Pan</i> the God
of Sheapards, not a few to <i>Diana</i> that extreamly delighted in
solitude and Woods; and some say <i>Mercury</i> himself: of all
which whilst <i>Grammarians</i> prattle, according to their usual
custome they egregiously trifle; they suffer themselves to be put
upon by Fables, and resign their judgment up to foolish pretentions,
but things and solid truth is that we seek after.</p>

<p>As about the Author, so concerning the place of its Birth there
is a great dispute, some say <i>Sparta</i>, others <i>Peloponesus</i>,
but most are for <i>Sicily</i>.</p>

<p><i>Valla the Placentine</i>, a curious searcher into Antiquity,
thinks this sort of Poetry first appear’d amongst the
<i>Lacedemonians</i>, for when the <i>Persians</i> had wasted
allmost all <i>Greece</i>, the <i>Spartans</i> say <span class = "pagenum">12</span>
that they for fear of the <i>Barbarians</i> fled into Caves and
lurking holes; and that the Country Youth then began to apply
themselves in Songs to <i>Diana Caryatis</i>, together with the
Maids, who midst their Songs offerd Flowers to the Goddess: which
custome containing somewhat of Religion was in those places a long
time very scrupulously observed.</p>

<p><i>Diomedes</i> the Grammarian, in his treatise of
<i>Measures</i>, declares <i>Sicily</i> to be the Place: for thus
he says, the <i>Sicilian</i> Sheapards in time of a great
<i>Pestilence</i>, began to invent new Ceremonies to appease
incensed <i>Diana</i>, whom afterward, for affording her help, and
stopping the Plague they called <span class = "greek">Λύην</span>:
<i>i.e.</i> the <i>Freer</i> from their Miserys. This grew into
custom, and the Sheapards used to meet in Companies, to sing their
deliverer <i>Diana’s</i> praise, and these afterwards passing into
<i>Italy</i> were there named <i>Bucoliastæ</i>.</p>

<p><i>Pomponius Sabinus</i> tells the story thus: When the Hymns the
Virgins us’d to sing in the Country to <i>Diana</i> were left off,
because, by reason of the present Wars, the Maidens were forc’t to
keep close within the Towns; the Shepherds met, and sang these kind
of Songs, which are now call’d <i>Bucolicks</i>, to <i>Diana</i>;
to whom they could not give the usual worship by reason of the Wars:
But <i>Donatus</i> says, that this kind of Verses was first sung to
<i>Diana</i> by <i>Orestes</i>, when he wandred about <i>Italy</i>;
after he fled from <i>Scythia Taurica</i>, and had <span class = "pagenum">13</span>
taken away the Image of the Goddess and hid it in a bundle of
sticks, whence she receiv’d the name of <i>Fascelina</i>, or
<i>Phacelide</i> <span class = "greek">ἀπὸ τοῦ φακέλου</span> At
whose Altar, the very same <i>Orestes</i> was afterward expiated by
his Sister <i>Iphigenia</i>: But how can any one rely on such
Fables, when the inconsiderable Authors that propose them disagree
so much amongst themselves?</p>

<p>Some are of Opinion that the Shepherds, were wont in solem and
set Songs about the Fields and Towns to celebrate the Goddess
<i>Pales</i>; and beg her to bless their flocks and fields with a
plenteous encrease and that from hence the name, and composure of
<i>Bucolicks</i> continued.</p>

<p>Other prying ingenious Men make other conjectures, as to this
mazing Controversy thus <i>Vossius</i> delivers himself; <i>The
Antients cannot be reconcil’d, but I rather incline to their opinion
who think</i> Bucolicks <i>were invented either by the</i> Sicilians
<i>or</i> Peloponesians, <i>for both those use the</i> Dorick
<i>dialect, and all the</i> Greek Bucolicks <i>are writ in that</i>:
As for my self I think, that what <i>Horace</i> says of <i>Elegies</i>
may be apply’d to the present Subject.</p>

<div class = "verse"><i>But who soft Elegies was the first that wrote<br>
Grammarians doubt, and cannot end the doubt:</i></div>

<p>For I find nothing certain about this matter, since neither
<i>Valla</i> a diligent inquirer after, and a good judge in such
things, nor any of the late writers produce any thing upon which I can
safely rely; yet what beginning this kind of Poetry <span class = "pagenum">14</span>
had, I think I can pretty well conjecture: for tis
likely that first Shepherds us’d Songs to recreate themselves in their
leisure hours whilst they fed their Sheep; and that each man, as his
wit served, accommodated his Songs to his present Circumstances: to
this Solitude invited, and the extream leisure that attends that
employment absolutely requir’d it: For as their retirement gave them
leisure, and Solitude a fit place for Meditation, Meditation and
Invention produc’d a Verse; which is nothing else but a Speech fit to
be sung, and so Songs began: Thus <i>Hesiod</i> was made a Poet, for
he acknowledges himself that he receiv’d his inspiration;</p>

<div class = "verse"><i>Whilst under </i>Helicon <i>he fed his Lambs</i>.</div>

<p>for either the leisure or fancy of Shepherds seems to have a
natural aptitude to Verse.</p>

<p>And indeed I cannot but agree with <i>Lucretius</i> that accurate
Searcher into Nature, who delivers that from that state of Innocence
the Golden Age, Pastorals continued down to his time, for after he had
in his fifth book describ’d that most happy age, he adds,</p>

<div class = "verse"><i>For then the Rural Muses reign’d</i>.</div>

<p>From whence ’tis very plain, that as <i>Donatus</i> himself
observ’d, Pastorals were the invention of the simplicity and innocence
of that Golden age, if there was ever any such, or certainly of that
time which succeeded the beginning of the World: For tho the Golden
Age must be ac<span class = "pagenum">15</span>knowledged to be only
in the fabulous times, yet ’tis certain that the Manners of the first
Men were so plain and simple, that we may easily derive both the
innocent imployment of Shepherds, and Pastorals from them.</p>
<hr>
<span class = "pagenum">16</span>

<p align = "center"><a name="second"><font size = "+1"><i>The Second</i><span class = "extended"> PAR</span>T.</font></a></p>

<p><span class = "firstletter">N</span>OW let us inquire into the
nature of <i>Pastoral</i>, in what its excellencies consist, and how
it must be made to be exact: And this must needs be a hard Task, since
I have no guide, neither <i>Aristotle</i> nor <i>Horace</i> to direct
me; for both they, whatever was the matter, speak not one word of this
sort of Verse. And I am of opinion that none can treat well and
clearly of any kind of <i>Poetry</i> if he hath no helps from these
two: But since they lay down some general Notions of <i>Poetry</i>
which may be useful in the present case, I shall follow their steps as
close as possible I can.</p>

<p>Not only <i>Aristotle</i> but <i>Horace</i> too hath defin’d that
<i>Poetry</i> in general is Imitation; I mention only these two, for
tho <i>Plato</i> in his Second Book <i>de Rep.</i> and in his
<i>Timæus</i> delivers the same thing, I shall not make use of his
Authority at all: Now as <i>Comedy</i> according to <i>Aristotle</i>
is the <i>Image and Representation of a gentiel and City Life</i>, so
is <i>Pastoral Poetry</i> of a County and <i>Sheapards</i> Life; for
since <i>Poetry</i> in general is Imitation; its several
<i>Species</i> must likewise Imitate, take <i>Aristotles</i> own words
<i>Cap.</i> 1. <span class = "greek">πᾶσαι τυγχάνουσιν οὖσαι
μιμήσεις</span>; And these <i>Species</i> are <span class = "pagenum">17</span>
differenc’t either by the subject matter, when the things to be
imitated are quite different, or when the manner in which you
imitate, or the mode of imitation is so: <span class = "greek">ἐν
τρισὶ δὲ ταύταισ διαφοραῖς ἡ μιμησίς ἐστιν, ἐν οἷς καὶ ἅ, καὶ ὥς</span>:
Thus tho of <i>Epick</i> Poetry and <i>Tragedy</i> the
Subject is the same, and some great illustrious Action is to be
<i>imitated</i> by both, yet since one by representation, and the
other by plain narration imitates, each makes a different
<i>Species</i> of imitation. And <i>Comedy</i> and <i>Tragedy</i>, tho
they agree in this, that both represent, yet because the Matter is
different, and <i>Tragedy</i> must represent some brave action, and
<i>Comedy</i> a humor; these Two sorts of imitation are
<i>Specifically different</i>. And upon the same account, since
<i>Pastoral</i> chooses the
<ins class = "correction" title = "text reads 'mannes'">manners</ins>
of Sheapards for its imitation, it takes
from its matter a peculiar difference, by which it is distinguish’d
frõ all others.</p>

<p>But here <i>Benius</i> in his comments upon <i>Aristotle</i> hath
started a considerable query: which is this; Whether <i>Aristotle</i>,
when he reckons up the different <i>Species</i> of Poetry <i>Cap</i>
1. doth include <i>Pastoral,</i> or no? And about this I find learn’d
men cannot at all agree: which certainly <i>Benius</i> should have
determin’d, or not rais’d: some refer it to that sort which <i>was
sung to Pipes</i>, for that <i>Pastorals</i> were so <i>Apuleius</i>
intimates, when at the marriage Feast of <i>Phyche</i> He brings in
<i>Paniscus</i> singing <i>Bucolicks</i> to his Pipe; But since they
did not seriously enough consider, what <i>Aristotle</i> <span class = "pagenum">18</span>
meant by that which he calls <span class = "greek">αυλητικὴν</span>
they trifle, talk idly, and are not to be
heeded in this matter; For suppose some <i>Musitian</i> should sing
<i>Virgils Ænæis</i> to the Harp, (and <i>Ant. Lullus</i> says it hath
been done,) should we therefore reckon that divine and incomparable
Master of <i>Heroick</i> Poetry amongst the <i>Lyricks</i>?</p>

<p>Others with <i>Cæsius Bassus</i> and <i>Isacius Tzetzes</i> hold
that that distribution of <i>Poetry</i>, which <i>Aristotle</i> and
<i>Tully</i> hath left us, is deficient and imperfect; and that only
the chief Species are reckoned, but the more inconsiderable not
mention’d: I shall not here interest my self in that quarrel of the
<i>Criticks</i>, whether we have all <i>Aristotles</i> books of Poetry
or no; this is a considerable difficulty I confess, for
<i>Laertius</i> who accurately weighs this matter, says that he wrote
two books of <i>Poetry</i>, the one lost, and the other we have, tho
<i>Mutinensis</i> is of an other mind: but to end this dispute, I must
agree with <i>Vossius</i>, who says the Philosopher comprehended these
Species not expressly mentioned, under a higher and more noble head:
and that therefore <i>Pastoral</i> was contain’d in <i>Epick</i>. for
these are his own words, <i>besides there are Epicks of an inferior
rank, such as the Writers of Bucolicks</i>. <i>Sincerus</i>, as
<i>Minturnus</i> quotes him, is of the same mind, for thus he delivers
his opinion concerning <i>Epick Verse</i>: <i>The matters about which
these numbers may be employed is various; either mean and low, as in
Pastorals, great and lofty, as when <span class = "pagenum">19</span>
the Subject is Divine Things, or Heroick Actions, or of a middle rank,
as when we use them to deliver precepts in:</i> And this likewise he
signifys before, where he sets down three sorts of <i>Epicks</i>:
<i>one of which, says he, is divine, and the most excellent by much in
all Poetry</i>; the <i>other the lowest but most pure, in which
Theocritus excelled, which indeed shews nothing of Poetry beside the
bare numbers</i>: These points being thus settled, the remaining
difficultys will be more easily dispatched.</p>

<p>For as in <i>Dramatick</i> Poetry the Dignity and meanness of the
<i>Persons</i> represented make two different <i>Species of
imitation</i> the one <i>Tragick</i>, which agrees to none but great
and Illustrious persons, the other <i>Comick</i>, which suits with
common and gentile humors: so in <i>Epick</i> too, there may be
reckoned two sorts of <i>Imitation</i>, one of which belongs to
<i>Heroes</i>, and that makes the <i>Heroick</i>; the other to
<i>Rusticks</i> and <i>Sheapards</i> and that constitutes the
<i>Pastoral</i>, now as a <i>Picture</i> imitates the Features of the
face, so <i>Poetry</i> doth action, and tis not a representation of
the Person but the Action.
<span class = "sidenote"><i>The Definition of Pastoral</i>.</span>
From all which we may gather this definition of Pastoral: <i>It is the
imitation of the Action of a Sheapard, or of one taken under that
Character</i>: Thus <i>Virgil’s Gallus</i>, tho not really a
<i>Sheapard</i>, for he was a man of great quality in <i>Rome</i>, yet
belongs to <i>Pastoral</i>, because he is represented like a Sheapard:
hence the Poet:
</p>
<span class = "pagenum">20</span>
<div class = "verse"><i>The Goatherd and the heavy Heardsmen came,<br>
And ask’t what rais’d the deadly Flame.</i></div>

<p>The <i>Scene</i> lys amongst Sheapards, the <i>Swains</i> are
brought in, the <i>Herdsmen</i> come to see his misery, and the
fiction is suited to the real condition of a <i>Sheapard</i>; the same
is to be said for his <i>Silenus</i>, who tho he seems lofty, and to
sound to loud for an oaten reed, yet since what he sings he sings to
<i>Sheapards</i>, and suits his Subject to their apprehensions, his is
to be acknowledged <i>Pastoral</i>. This rule we must stick to, that
we might infallibly discern what is stricktly <i>Pastoral</i> in
<i>Virgil</i> and <i>Theocritus</i>, and what not: for in
<i>Theocritus</i> there are some more lofty thoughts which not having
any thing belonging to Sheapards for their Subject, must by no means
be accounted <i>Pastoral</i>, But of this more in its proper
place.</p>

<p>My present inquiry must be what is the <i>Subject Matter</i> of a
<i>Pastoral</i>, about which it is not easy to resolve; since neither
from <i>Aristotle</i>, nor any of the <i>Greeks</i> who have written
<i>Pastorals</i>, we can receive certain direction. For sometimes they
treat of high and sublime things, like <i>Epick Poets</i>; what can be
loftier than the whole <i>Seaventh Idyllium of Bias</i> in which
<i>Myrsan</i> urges <i>Lycidas</i> the Sheapard to sing the Loves of
<i>Deidamia</i> and <i>Achilles</i>. For he begins from <i>Helen’s</i>
rape, and goes on to the revengful fury of the <i>Atrides</i>, and
shuts up in one <i>Pastoral</i>, all that is great and sounding in
<i>Homers Iliad</i>.
</p>
<span class = "pagenum">21</span>
<div class = "verse"><i>Sparta was fir’d with Rage<br>
And gather’d Greece to prosecute Revenge.</i></div>

<p>And <i>Theocritus</i> his verses are sometimes as sounding and
his thoughts as high: for upon serious consideration I cannot mind
what part of all the <i>Heroicks</i> is so strong and sounding as
that <i>Idyllium</i> on <i>Hercules</i>
<span class = "greek">λεοντοφονω</span> in which <i>Hercules</i>
himself tells <i>Phyleus</i> how he kill’d the Lyon whose Skin he
wore: for, not to mention many, what can be greater than this
expression.</p>

<div class = "verse"><i>And gaping Hell received his mighty Soul</i>:</div>

<p>Why should I instance in the <span class = "greek">διόσκουροι</span>,
which hath not one line below Heroick; the greatness of this is
almost inexpressible.</p>

<div class = "verse"><span class = "greek">ἀνὴρ ὑπέροπλος ἐνήμερος, ἐνδιάασκε<br>
 δεινὸς ἰδεῖν</span></div>

<p>And some other pieces are as strong as these, such is the
<i>Panegyrick on Ptolemy</i>, <i>Helen’s Epithalamium</i>, and the
Fight of young <i>Hercules</i> and the Snakes: now how is it likely
that such Subjects should be fit for <i>Pastorals</i>, of which in my
opinion, the same may be said which <i>Ovid</i> doth of his
<i>Cydippe</i>.</p>

<div class = "verse"><i>Cydippe, Homer, doth not fit thy Muse.</i></div>

<p>For certainly <i>Pastorals</i> ought not to rise to the Majesty of
<i>Heroicks</i>: but who on the other side <span class = "pagenum">22</span>
dares reprehend such great and judicious Authors,
whose very doing it is Authority enough? What shall I say of
<i>Virgil</i>? who in his Sixth <i>Eclogue</i> hath put together
allmost all the particulars of the fabulous Age; what is so high to
which <i>Silenus</i> that Master of Mysterys doth not soar?</p>

<div class = "verse"><i>For lo! he sung the Worlds stupendious birth,<br>
How scatter’d seeds of sea, of Air, and Earth,<br>
And purer Fire thro universal night<br>

By circular successive order springs:</i></div>

<p>And afterward</p>

<div class = "verse"><i>How Pyrra’s Stony race rose from the ground,<br>

How bold</i> Prometheus <i>(whose untam’d desire,<br>
Rival’d the Sun with his own Heavenly Fire)<br>
Now doom’d the</i> Scythian <i>Vulturs endless prey<br>
Severely pays for Animating Clay:</i></div>

<p>So true, so certain ’tis, that nothing is so high and lofty to
which <i>Bucolicks</i> may not successfully aspire. But if this be so,
what will become of <i>Macrobius, Georgius Valla, Julius Scaliger,
Vossius,</i> and the whole company of Grammarians? who all affirm that
simplicity and meanness is so essential to <i>Pastorals</i>, that it
ought to be confin’d to the State, Manners, Apprehension and even
common phrases of Sheapards: for nothing can <span class = "pagenum">23</span>
be said to be <i>Pastoral</i>, which is not
accommodated to their condition; and for this Reason <i>Nannius
Alcmaritanus</i> in my opinion is a trifler, who, in his comments on
<i>Virgils Eclogues</i>, thinks that those sorts of Composures may now
and then be lofty, and treat of great subjects: where he likewise
divides the matter of <i>Bucolicks</i>, into <i>Low</i>,
<i>Middle</i>, and <i>High</i>: and makes <i>Virgil</i> the Author of
this Division, who in his Fourth <i>Eclogue</i>, (as he imagines)
divides the matter of <i>Bucolicks</i> into Three sorts, and intimates
this division by these three words: <i>Bushes</i>, <i>Shrubs</i> and
<i>Woods</i>.</p>

<div class = "verse"><i>Sicilian Muse begin a loftier strain,<br>
The Bushes and the Shrubs that shade the Plain<br>
Delight not all; if I to Woods repair<br>
My Song shall make them worth a Consuls Care</i>.</div>

<p>By Woods, as he fancys, as <i>Virgil</i> means high and stately
Trees, so He would have a great and lofty Subject to to be
implyed,such as he designed for the <i>Consul</i>: by Bushes, which
are almost even with the ground, the meanest and lowest argument; and
by Shrubs a Subject not so high as the one, nor so low as the other,
as the thing it-self is, And therefore these lines</p>

<div class = "verse">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>If I to Woods repair<br>
My Song shall make them worth a</i> Consuls <i>care</i>.</div>

<p><span class = "pagenum">24</span>
are thus to be understood, That if we choose high and sublime
arguments, our work will be fit for the Patronage of a <i>Consul</i>,
This is <i>Nanniu’s</i> interpretation of that place; too pedantial
and subtle I’me affraid, for tis not credible that ever <i>Virgil</i>
thought of reckoning great and lofty things amongst the Subjects of
<i>Bucolicks</i> especially since</p>

<div class = "verse"><i>When his</i> Thalia <i>rais’d her bolder voice<br>
And Kings and Battles were her lofty choice</i>,<br>
Phæbus <i>did twitch his Ear, mean thoughts infuse,<br>
And with this whisper check’t th’ inspiring Muse.<br>
A Sheapard, Tityrus, his Sheep should feed,<br>
And choose a subject suited to his reed</i>,</div>

<p>This certainly was a serious admonition, implyed by the twitching
of his Ear, and I believe if he had continued in this former humor and
not obey’d the smarting admonition. He had still felt it: so far was
he from thinking Kings and Battels fit Themes for a <i>Sheapards</i>
song: and this evidently shows that in <i>Virgils</i> opinion,
contrary to <i>Nanniu’s</i> fancy, great things cannot in the least be
comprehended within the subject matter of <i>Pastorals;</i> no, it
must be low and humble, which <i>Theocritus</i> very happily
expresseth by this word <span class = "greek">Βουκολιάσδην</span>
<i>i. e.</i> as the interpreters explain it, sing humble Strains.</p>

<p><ins class = "correction" title = "text reads 'theefore'">Therefore</ins>
let <i>Pastoral</i> never venture upon a <span class = "pagenum">25</span>
lofty subject, let it not recede one
jot from its proper matter, but be employ’d about Rustick affairs:
such as are mean and humble in themselves; and such are the affairs of
Shepherds, especially their Loves, but those must be pure and
innocent; not disturb’d by vain suspitious jealousy, nor polluted by
Rapes; The Rivals must not fight, and their emulations must be without
quarrellings: such as <i>Vida</i> meant.</p>

<div class = "verse"><i>Whilst on his Reed he Shepherd’s <ins class = "correction" title = "text reads 'stifes'">strifes</ins> conveys,<br>

<p>To these may be added <i>sports, Jests, Gifts</i>, and
<i>Presents</i>; but not <i>costly</i>, such are yellow Apples, young
stock-Doves, Milk, Flowers, and the like; all things must appear
delightful and easy, nothing vitious and rough: A perfidious Pimp, a
designing Jilt, a gripeing Usurer, a crafty factious Servant must have
no room there, but every part must be full of the simplicity of the
<i>Golden-Age</i>, and of that Candor which was then eminent: for as
<i>Juvenal affirms</i></p>

<div class = "verse"><i>Baseness was a great wonder in that Age</i>;</div>

<p>Sometimes <i>Funeral-Rites</i> are the subject of an
<i>Eclogue</i>, where the Shepherds scatter flowers on the Tomb, and
sing Rustick Songs in honor of the Dead: Examples of this kind are
left us by <i>Virgil</i> in his <i>Daphnis</i>, and <i>Bion</i> in his
<i>Adonis</i>, and this hath nothing disagreeable to a Shepherd: In
<span class = "pagenum">26</span> short whatever, the decorum being
still preserv’d, can be done by a <i>Sheapard</i>, may be the Subject
of a <i>Pastoral</i>.</p>

<p>Now there may be more kinds of Subjects than <i>Servius</i> or
<i>Donatus</i> allow, for they confine us to that Number which
<i>Virgil</i> hath made use of, tho <i>Minturnus</i> in his second
Book <i>de Poetâ</i> declares against this opinion: But as a glorious
<i>Heroick</i> action must be the Subject of an <i>Heroick</i> Poem,
so a <i>Pastoral</i> action of a <i>Pastoral</i>; at least it must be
so turn’d and wrought, that it might appear to be the action of a
<i>Shepherd</i>; which caution is very necessary to be observ’d, to
clear a great many difficulties in this matter: for tho as the
Interpreters assure us; most of <i>Virgils</i> Eclogues are about the
Civil war, planting Colonys, the murder of the Emperor, and the like,
which in themselves are too great and too lofty for humble
<i>Pastoral</i> to reach, yet because they are accomodated to the
Genius of Shepherds, may be the Subject of an <i>Eclogue</i>, for that
sometimes will admit of Gods and Heroes so they appear like, and are
shrouded under the Persons of Shepherds: But as for these matters
which neither really are, nor are so wrought as to seem the actions of
Shepherds, such are in <i>Moschus</i>’s <i>Europa</i>,
<i>Theocritus</i>’s <i>Epithalamium of Helen</i>, and <i>Virgil</i>’s
<i>Pollio</i>, to declare my opinion freely, I cannot think them to be
fit Subjects for <i>Bucolicks</i>: And upon this account I suppose
’tis that <i>Servius</i> in his <span class = "pagenum">27</span>
Comments on <i>Virgil</i>’s <i>Bucoliks</i> reckons only seven of
<i>Virgil</i>’s ten Eclogues, and onely ten of <i>Theocritus</i>’s
thirty, to be pure Pastorals, and <i>Salmasius</i> upon <i>Solinus</i>
says, that <i>amongst Theocritus</i>’s <i>Poems there are some which
you may call what you please Beside Pastorals</i>: and <i>Heinsius</i>
in his <i>Scholia</i> upon <i>Theocritus</i> will allow but Ten of his
<i>Idylliums</i> to be <i>Bucoliks</i>, 1. 2. 3. 4. 5. 6. 7. 8. 9. 11.
for all the rest are deficient either in matter or form, and from this
number of pure pastoral <i>Idylliums</i> I am apt to think, that
<i>Theocritus</i> seems to have made that Pipe, on which he tun’d his
<i>Pastorals</i> and which he consecrated to <i>Pan</i> of ten Reeds,
as <i>Salmasius</i> in his notes on <i>Theocritus</i>’s Pipe hath
learnedly observed: <i>in which two Verses always make one Reed of the
Pipe, therefore all are so unequal, like the unequal Reeds of a Pipe,
that if you put two equals together which make one Reed, the whole
inequality consists in ten pairs</i>; when in the common Pipes there
were usually no more then seven Reeds, and this the less curious
observers have heedlessly past by.</p>

<p>Some are of opinion that whatever is done in the Country, and in
one word, every thing that hath nought of the City in it may be
treated of in <i>Pastorals</i>; and that the discourse of Fishers,
Plow-men, Reapers, Hunters, and the like, belong to this kind of
Poetry: which according to the Rule that I have laid down cannot be
true for, as I before hinted nothing but the action of a <span class = "pagenum">28</span>
Shepherd can be the Subject of a Pastoral.</p>

<p>I shall not here enquire, tho it may seem proper, whether we can
decently bring into an Eclogue Reapers, Vine-dressers, Gardners,
Fowlers, Hunters, Fishers, or the like, whose lives for the most part
are taken up with too much business and employment to have any vacant
time for Songs, and idle Chat, which are more agreeable to the leisure
of a Sheapards Life: for in a great many Rustick affairs, either the
hardship and painful Labor will not admit a song, as in Plowing, or
the solitude as in hunting, Fishing, Fowling, and the like; but of
this I shall discourse more largely in another place.</p>

<p>Now ’tis not sufficient to make a Poem a true <i>Pastoral</i>,
that the Subject of it is the action of a Shepherd, for in
<i>Hesiods</i> <span class = "greek">ἔργα</span> and <i>Virgils
Georgicks</i> there are a great many things that belong to the
employment of a Shepherd, yet none fancy they are Pastorals; from
whence ’tis evident, that beside the <i>matter</i>, which we have
defin’d to be the action of a Sheapard, there is a peculiar
<i>Form</i> proper to this kind of <i>Poetry</i> by which ’tis
distinguish’d from all others.</p>

<p>Of Poetry in General <i>Socrates</i>, as <i>Plato</i> tells us,
would have <i>Fable</i> to be the <i>Form</i>: <i>Aristotle</i>
Imitation: I shall not dispute what difference there is between these
two, but only inquire whether Imitation be the <i>Form</i> of
<i>Pastoral</i>: ’tis certain that <i>Epick</i> Poetry is differenc’t
from <i>Tragick</i> on<span class = "pagenum">29</span>ly by the
manner of imitation, for the latter imitates by <i>action</i>, and the
former by bare <i>narration</i>: But <i>Pastoral</i> is the imitation
of a <i>Pastoral</i> action either by bare narration, as in
<i>Virgil</i>’s <i>Alexis</i>, and <i>Theocritus</i>’s 7<i>th
Idyllium</i>, in which the Poet speaks all along in his own Person: or
by action as in <i>Virgil</i>’s <i>Tityrus</i>, and the first of
<i>Theocritus</i>, or by both mixt, as in the Second and Eleventh
<i>Idylliums</i>, in which the Poet partly speaks in his own Person,
and partly makes others speak, and I think the old <i>Scholiast</i> on
<i>Theocritus</i> took an hint from these when he says, that Pastoral
is a mixture made up of all sorts, for ’tis Narrative, Dramatick, and
mixt, and <i>Aristotle</i>, tho obscurely, seems to hint in those
words, <i>In every one of the mentioned Arts there is Imitation, in
some simple, in some mixt</i>; now this latter being peculiar to
<i>Bucolicks</i> makes its very form and Essence: and therefore
<i>Scaliger</i>, in the 4<i>th</i> Chapter of his first Book of
Poetry, reckons up three Species of <i>Pastorals</i>, the first hath
but one Person, the second several, which sing alternately; the third
is mixt of both the other: And the same observation is made by
<i>Heinsius</i> in his Notes on <i>Theocritus</i>, for thus he very
plainly to our purpose, <i>the Character of</i> Bucolicks <i>is a
mixture of all sorts of Characters, Dramatick, Narrative, or mixt</i>:
from all which ’tis very manifest that the manner of <i>Imitation</i>
which is proper to <i>Pastorals</i> is the mixt: for in other kinds of
Poetry ’tis one and simple, at least <span class = "pagenum">30</span>
not so manifold; as in <i>Tragedy Action</i>: in <i>Epick</i> Poetry
<i>Narration</i>.</p>

<p>Now I shall explain what sort of <i>Fable</i>; <i>Manners</i>,
<i>Thought</i>, <i>Expression</i>, which four are necessary to
constitute every kind of Poetry, are proper to this sort.</p>
<br>
<p><i>Concerning the Fable which</i> Aristotle <i>calls,</i>
<span class = "greek">σύνθεσιν τῶν πραγμάτων</span>,</p>

<p>I have but one thing to say: this, as the Philosopher hints, as of
all other sorts of Poetry, so of Pastoral is the very Soul. and
therfore <i>Socrates</i> in <i>Plato</i> says, that in those Verses
which he had made there was nothing wanting but the <i>Fable</i>:
therefore Pastorals as other kinds of Poetry must have their Fable, if
they will be Poetry: Thus in <i>Virgil</i>’s <i>Silenus</i> which
contains the Stories of allmost the whole Fabulous Age, two Shepherds
whom <i>Silenus</i> had often promis’d a Song, and as often deceived,
seize upon him being drunk and asleep, and bind him with wreath’d
Flowers; <i>Ægle</i> comes in and incourages the timorous youths, and
stains his jolly red Face with Blackberries, <i>Silenus</i> laughs at
their innocent contrivance, and desires to be unbound, and then with a
premeditated Song satisfies the Nymph’s and Boys Curiosity; The
incomparable Poet sings wonders, the Rocks rejoyce, the Vales eccho,
and happy <i>Eurotas</i> as if <i>Phœbus</i> himself sang, hears all,
and bids the Laurels that grow upon his Banks listen to, and learn
the Song.
</p>
<span class = "pagenum">31</span>
<div class = "verse"><i>Happy</i> Eurotas <i>as he flow’d along<br>
Heard all, and bad the Laurels learn the Song.</i></div>

<p>Thus every Eclogue or Idyllium must have its Fable, which must be
the groundwork of the whole design, but it must not be perplext with
sudden and unlookt for changes, as in <i>Marinus</i>’s <i>Adonis</i>:
for that, tho the <i>Fable</i> be of a Shepherd, yet by reason of the
strange Bombast under Plots, and wonderful occurences, cannot be
accounted <i>Pastoral</i>; for that it might be agreeable to the
Person it treats of, it must be plain and simple, such as
<i>Sophocles</i>’s <i>Ajax</i>, in which there is not so much as one
change of Fortune. As for the Manners, let that precept, which
<i>Horace</i> lays down in his Epistle to the <i>Pisones</i>, be
principally observed.</p>

<div class = "verse"><i>Let each be grac’t with that which suits him best</i>.</div>

<p>For this, as ’tis a rule relateing to <i>Poetry</i> in general, so
it respects this kind also of which we are treating; and against this
<i>Tasso</i> in his <i>Amyntas</i>, <i>Bonarellus</i> in his
<i>Phyllis</i>, <i>Guarinus</i> in his <i>Pastor Fido</i>,
<i>Marinus</i> in his <i>Idylliums</i>, and most of the
<i>Italians</i> grievously offend, for they make their
<i>Shepherds</i> too polite, and elegant, and cloth them with all the
neatness of the Town, and Complement of the Court, which tho it may
seem very pretty, yet amongst good <i>Critics</i>, let <i>Veratus</i>
<span class = "pagenum">32</span> say what he will in their excuse, it
cannot be allowed: For ’tis against <i>Minturnus</i>’s Opinion, who in
his second Book <i>de Poetâ</i> says thus: <i>Mean Persons are brought
in, those in Comedy indeed more polite, those in Pastorals more
unelegant, as suppos’d to lead a rude life in Solitude</i>; and
<i>Jason Denor</i> a Doctor of <i>Padua</i> takes notice of the same
as a very absurd Error: <i>Aristotle</i> heretofore for a like fault
reprehended the <i>Megarensians</i>, who observ’d no <i>Decorum</i> in
their <i>Theater</i>, but brought in mean persons with a Train fit for
a <i>King</i> and cloath’d a Cobler or Tinker in a Purple Robe: In
vain doth <i>Veratus</i> in his Dispute against <i>Jason Denor</i>, to
defend those elaborately exquisite discourses, and notable sublime
sentences of his <i>Pastor Fido</i>, bring some lofty <i>Idylliums</i>
of <i>Theocritus</i>, for those are not acknowledged to be Pastoral;
<i>Theocritus</i> and <i>Virgil</i> must be consulted in this matter,
the former designdly makes his Shepherds discourse in the
<i>Dorick</i> i. e. the Rustick Dialect, sometimes scarce true
Grammar; &amp; the other studiously affects ignorance in the persons of
his Shepherds, as <i>Servius</i> hath observ’d, and is evident in
<i>Melibæus</i>, who makes <i>Oaxes</i> to be a River in <i>Crete</i>
when ’tis in <i>Mesopotamia</i>: and both of them take this way that
the Manners may the more exactly suit with the Persons they represent,
who of themselves are rude and unpolisht: And this proves that they
scandalously err, who make their Shepherds appear polite and elegant;
nor can I imagine what <i>Veratus</i> <span class =
"pagenum">33</span> who makes so much ado about the polite manners of
the <i>Arcadian</i> Shepherds, would say to <i>Polybius</i> who tells
us that <i>Arcadians</i> by reason of the Mountainousness of the
Country and hardness of the weather, are very unsociable and
austere.</p>

<p>Now as too much neatness in <i>Pastoral</i> is not to be allow’d,
so rusticity (I do not mean that which <i>Plato</i>, in his Third Book
of a Commonwealth, mentions which is but a part of a down right
honesty) but Clownish stupidity, such as <i>Theophrastus</i>, in his
Character of a <i>Rustick</i>, describes; or that disagreeable
unfashionable roughness which <i>Horace</i> mentions in his Epistle to
<i>Lollius</i>, must not in my opinion be endur’d: On this side
<i>Mantuan</i> errs extreamly, and is intolerably absur’d, who makes
Shepherds blockishly sottish, and insufferably rude: And a certain
Interpreter blames <i>Theocritus</i> for the same thing, who in some
mens opinion sometimes keeps too close to the <i>Clown</i>, and is
rustick and uncouth; But this may be very well excus’d because the Age
in which he sang was not as polite as now.</p>

<p>But that every Part may be suitable to a Shepherd, we must consult
unstain’d, uncorrupted Nature; so that the manners might not be too
Clownish nor too Caurtly: And this mean may be easily observed if the
manners of our Shepherds be represented according to the <i>Genius</i>
of the <i>golden Age</i>, in which, if <i>Guarinus</i> may be be<span
class = "pagenum">34</span>liev’d, every man follow’d that employment:
And <i>Nannius</i> in the Preface to his Comments on <i>Virgil</i>’s
<i>Bucolicks</i> is of the same opinion, for he requires that the
manners might represent the Golden Age: and this was the reason that
<i>Virgil</i> himself in his <i>Pollio</i> describes that Age, which
he knew very well was proper to <i>Bucolicks</i>: For in the whole
course of a Shepherds life there can be no form more excellent than
that which was the practise of the Golden Age; And this may serve to
moderate and temper the affections that must be exprest in this sort
of Poetry, and sufficiently declare the whole Essence of it, which in
short must be taken from the nature of a Shepherds life to which a
Courtly dress is not agreeable.</p>

<p>That the Thought may be commendable, it must be suitable to the
<i>manners</i>; as those must be plain and pure that must be so too:
nor must contain any, deep, exquisite, or elaborate fancies: And
against this the <i>Italians</i> offend, who continually hunt after
smart witty sayings, very foolishly in my opinion; for in the Country,
where all things should be full of plainess and simplicity who would
paint or endeavor to be gawdy when such appearances would be very
disagreeable and offend? <i>Pontanus</i> in this matter hath said very
well, <i>The Thought must not be to exquisite and witty, the
Comparisons obvious and common, such as the State of Persons and
Things require</i>: Yet tho too scrupulous a Curiosity in Ornament
ought to be re<span class = "pagenum">35</span>jected, yet lest the
Thought be cold and flat, it must have some quickness of Passion, as
in these.</p>

<div class = "verse"><i>Cruel</i> Alexis <i>can’t my Verses move?<br>
Hast thou no Pitty? I must dye for Love</i>.</div>

<p>And again, </p>

<div class = "verse"><i>He neither Gods, nor yet my Verse regards</i>.</div>

<p>The Sense must not be long, copious, and continued,
For<i>Pastoral</i> is weak, and not able to hold out; but of this more
when I come to lay down rules for its Composure: But tho it ought to
imitate <i>Comedy</i> in its common way of discourse, yet it must not
chose <i>old Comedy</i> for its pattern, for that is too impudent, and
licentiously abusive: Let it be free and modest, honest and ingenuous,
and that will make it agreeable to the Golden Age.</p>

<p>Let the Expression be plain and easy, but elegant and neat, and the
purest which the language will afford; <i>Pontanus</i> upon
<i>Virgils</i> Bucolicks gives the very same rule, <i>In Bucolicks the
Expression must be humble, nearer common discourse than otherwise, not
very Spirituous and vivid, yet such as shows life and strength</i>:
Tis certain that <i>Virgil</i> in his <i>Bucolicks</i> useth the same
words which <i>Tully</i> did in the <i>Forum</i> or the <i>Senate</i>;
and <i>Tityrus</i> beneath his shady Beech speaks as pure and good
<i>Latin</i> as <i>Augustus</i> in his Palace, as <i>Modicius</i> in
his <i>Apology</i> for <i>Virgil</i> hath excellently observ’d: <span
class = "pagenum">36</span> This rule, ’tis true; <i>Theocritus</i>
hath not so strictly follow’d, whose Rustick and Pastoral Muse, as
<i>Quintilian</i> phraseth it, <i>not only is affraid to appear in
the</i> Forum, <i>but the City</i>, and for the very same thing an
<i>Alexandrian</i> flouts the <i>Syracucusian Weomen</i> in the
Fifteenth <i>Idyllium</i> of <i>Theocritus</i>, for when they, being
then in the City, spoke the <i>Dorick</i> Dialect, the delicate
Citizen could not endure it, and found fault with their distastful, as
he thought, pronunciation: and his reflection was very smart.</p>

<div class = "verse"><i>Like Pidgeons you have mouths from Ear to Ear</i>.</div>

<p>So intolerable did that broad way of pronunciation, tho exactly fit
for a Clowns discourse, seem to a Citizen: and hence <i>Probus</i>
observes that ’twas much harder for the <i>Latines</i> to write
<i>Pastorals</i> than for the <i>Greeks</i>; because the
<i>Latines</i> had not some <i>Dialects</i> peculiar to the Country,
and others to the City, as the <i>Greeks</i> had; Besides the
<i>Latine</i> Language, as <i>Quintilian</i> hath observ’d, is not
capable of the neatness which is necessary to Bucolicks, no, that is
the peculiar priviledge of the <i>Greeks</i>: <i>We cannot</i>, says
he, <i>be so low, they exceed us in subtlety, and in propriety they
are at more certainty than We</i>: and again, <i>in pat and close
Expressions we cannot reach the Greeks</i>: And, if we believe
<i>Tully</i>, <i>Greek is much more fit for Ornament than Latin</i>
for it hath much more of that neatness, <span class =
"pagenum">37</span> and ravishing delightfulness, which
<i>Bucolicks</i> necessarily require.</p>

<p>Yet of Pastoral, with whose Nature we are not very well acquainted,
what that <i>Form</i> is which the <i>Greeks</i> call the
<i>Character</i>, is not very easy to determine; yet that we may come
to some certainty, we must stick to our former observation,
<i>viz.</i> that <i>Pastoral</i> belongs properly to the <i>Golden
Age</i>: For as <i>Tully</i> in his Treatise <i>de Oratore</i> says,
<i>in all our disputes the Subject is to be measur’d by the most
perfect of that kind</i>, and <i>Synesius</i> in his <i>Encomium</i>
on <i>Baldness</i> hints the very same, when he tells us that Poetry
fashions its subject as Men imagine it should be, and not as really it is:
<span class = "greek">πρὸς δόξαν, οὐ πρὸς ἀλήθειαν</span>: Now
the Life of a Shepherd, that it might be rais’d to the highest
perfection, is to be referr’d to the manners and age of the world
whilst yet innocent, and such as the Fables have describ’d it: And as
Simplicity was the principal vertue of that Age, so it ought to be the
peculiar Grace, and as it were <i>Character</i> of <i>Bucolicks</i>:
in which the Fable, Manners, Thought, and Expression ought to be full
of the most innocent simplicity imaginable: for as Innocence in Life,
so purity and simplicity in discourse was the Glory of that Age: So as
gravity to <i>Epicks</i>, Sweetness to <i>Lyricks</i>, Humor to
<i>Comedy</i>, softness to <i>Elegies</i> and smartness to
<i>Epigrams</i>, so simplicity to <i>Pastorals</i> is proper; and one
upon <i>Theocritus</i> says, <i>that the Idea of his Bucolicks is in
every part pure, and in all <span class = "pagenum">38</span> that
belongs to simplicity very happy</i>: Such is this of <i>Virgil</i>,
<i>unwholsome to us Singers is the shade</i></p>

<div class = "verse"><i>Of Juniper, ’tis an unwholsome shade</i>:</div>

<p>Than which in my opinion nothing can be more simply; nothing more
rustically said; and this is the reason I suppose why <i>Macrobius</i>
says that this kind of Poetry is creeping and upon mean subjects; and
why too <i>Virgils Tityrus</i> lying under his shady Beech displeaseth
some; Excellent Criticks indeed, whom I wish a little more sense, that
they might not really be, what they would not seem to be,
<i>Ridiculous</i>: <i>Theocritus</i> excells <i>Virgil</i> in this, of
whom <i>Modicius</i> says, <i>Theocritus deserves the greatest
commendation for his happy imitation of the simplicity of his
Shepherds</i>, Virgil <i>hath mixt Allegories, and some other things
which contain too much learning, and deepness of Thought for Persons
of so mean a Quality</i>: Yet here I must obviate their mistake who
fancy that this sort of <i>Poetry</i>, because in it self low and
simple, is the proper work of <i>mean</i> Wits, and not the most
<i>sublime</i> and <i>excellent</i> perfections: For as I think there
be can nothing more elegant than easy naked simplicity, so likewise
nothing can require more strength of Wit, and greater pains; and he
must be of a great and clear judgment, who attempts <i>Pastoral</i>,
and comes of with Honor. For there is no part of <i>Poetry</i> that
requires more spirit, for if any part is not close and well compacted
the whole Fabrick will be ruin’d, and the <span class = "pagenum">39</span>
matter, in it self humble, must creep; unless it
is held up by the strength and vigor of the <i>Expression</i>.</p>

<p>Another qualification and excellence of <i>Pastoral</i> is to
imitate <i>Timanthes</i>’s Art, of whom <i>Pliny</i> writes thus;
<i>Timanthes was very Ingenious, in all his peices more was to be
understood than the Colours express’d, and tho his Art was very
extraordinary yet his Fancy exceeded it</i>: In this <i>Virgil</i> is
peculiarly happy, but others, especially raw unexperienced Writers, if
they are to describe a Rainbow, or a River, pour out their whole
stock, and are unable to contain: Now ’tis properly requisite to a
Pastoral that there should be a great deal coucht in a few words, and
every thing it says should be so short, and so close, as if its
chiefest excellence was to be spareing in Expression: such is that of
<i>Virgil</i>;</p>

<div class = "verse"><i>These Fields and Corn shall a Barbarian share?<br>
See the Effects of all our Civil War</i>.</div>

<p>How short is that? how concise? and yet how full of sense in the same <i>Eclogue</i>.</p>

<div class = "verse"><i>I wonder’d why all thy complaints were made,<br>
Absent was</i> Tityrus:</div>

<p>And the like you may every where meet with, as</p>

<div class = "verse">Mopsus <i>weds</i> Nisa, <i>what may’nt Lovers hope</i>?</div>

<p>and in the second <i>Eclogue</i>,</p>

<span class = "pagenum">40</span><div class = "verse">
<i>Whom dost thou fly ah frantick! oft the Woods<br>
Hold Gods, and</i> Paris <i>equal to the Gods</i>.</div>

<p>This Grace <i>Virgil</i> learn’d from <i>Theocritus</i>, allmost
most all whose Periods; especially in the third <i>Idyllium</i>,
have no conjunction to connect them, that the sense might be more
close, and the Affection vehement and strong: as in this</p>

<div class = "verse"><i>Let all things change, let Pears the Firs adorn<br>
Now</i> Daphnis <i>dyes</i>.</div>

<p>And in the third <i>Eclogue</i>.</p>

<div class = "verse"><i>But when she saw, how great was the surprize</i>! &amp;c.</div>

<p>And any one may find a great many of the like in <i>Theocritus</i>
and <i>Virgil</i>, if with a leisurely delight he nicely examines
their delicate Composures: And this I account the greatest grace in
<i>Pastorals</i>, which in my opinion those that write
<i>Pastorals</i> do not sufficiently observe: ’tis true Ours (the
<i>French</i>) and the <i>Italian</i> language is to babling to endure
it; This is the Rock on which those that write <i>Pastorals</i> in
their <i>Mother</i> tongue are usually split, But the <i>Italians</i>
are inevitably lost; who having store of <i>Wit</i>, a very subtle
invention and flowing fancy, cannot contain; everything that comes
into their mind must be poured out, nor are they able to endure the
least restraint: as is evident from <i>Marinus</i>’s <i>Idylliums</i>,
and a great many of that nation who have ventur’d on such composures;
For unless there are many <span class = "pagenum">41</span> stops and
breakings off in the series of a <i>Pastoral</i>, it can neither be
pleasing nor artificial: And in my Opinion <i>Virgil</i> excells
<i>Theocritus</i> in this, for <i>Virgil</i> is neither so continued,
nor so long as <i>Theocritus</i>; who indulges too much the garrulity
of his <i>Greek</i>; nay even in those things which he expresseth he
is more close, and more cautiously conceals that part which ought to
be dissembled: And this I am sure is a most admirable part of
Eloquence; as <i>Tully</i> in his Epistle to <i>Atticus</i> says,
<i>’tis rare to speak Eloquently, but more rare to be eloquently
silent</i>: And this unskillful <i>Criticks</i> are not acquainted
with, and therefore are wont oftner to find fault with that which is
not fitly exprest, than commend that which is prudently conceal’d: I
could heap up a great many more things to this purpose, but I see no
need of such a trouble, since no man can rationally doubt of the
goodness of my Observation. Therefore, in short, let him that writes
Pastorals think brevity, if it doth not obscure his sense, to be the
greatest grace which he can attain.</p>

<p>Now why <i>Bucolicks</i> should require such Brevity, and be so
essentially sparing in <i>Expression</i>, I see no other reason but
this: It loves <i>Simplicity</i> so much that it must be averse to
that Pomp and Ostentation which <i>Epick</i> Poetry must show, for
that must be copious and flowing, in every part smooth, and equal to
it self: But <i>Pastoral</i> must dissemble, and hide even that which
it would <span class = "pagenum">42</span> show, like <i>Damon</i>’s
<i>Galatea</i>, who flies then when she most desires to be
discovered.</p>

<div class = "verse"><i>And to the Bushes flys, yet would be seen</i>.</div>

<p>And this doth not proceed from any malitious ill-natur’d Coyness,
as some imagine, but from an ingenuous modesty and bashfulness, which
usually accompanies, and is a proof of <i>Simplicity: Tis very
rare</i>, says Pliny, <i>to find a man so exquisitely skillful, as to
be able to show those Features in a Picture which he hides</i>, and I
think it to be so difficult a task, that none but the most excellent
Wits can attempt it with success: For small Wits usually abound with a
multitude of words.</p>

<p>The third Grace of <i>Bucolicks</i> is <i>Neatness</i>, which
contains all the taking prettiness and sweetness of Expression, and
whatsoever is call’d the Delicacies of the more delightful and
pleasing <i>Muses</i>: This the Rural <i>Muses</i> bestow’d on
<i>Virgil</i>, as <i>Horace</i> in the tenth <i>Satyr</i> of his first
Book says,</p>

<div class = "verse"><i>And</i> Virgils <i>happy Muse in Eclogues plays,<br>
soft and facetious</i>;</div>

<p>Which <i>Fabius</i> takes to signify the most taking neatness and
most exquisite Elegance imaginable: For thus he explains this place,
in which he agrees with <i>Tully</i>, who in his <i>Third Book de
Oratore</i>, says, the <i>Atticks</i> are Facetious <i>i.e.</i>
elegant: Tho the common Interpreters of these words are not of the
same mind: But if by <i>Facetious Horace</i> had meant <i>jesting</i>,
and such as is design’d to make men laugh, and apply’d that to
<i>Virgil</i>, nothing <span class = "pagenum">43</span> could have
been more ridiculous; ’tis the design of <i>Comedy</i> to raise
laughter, but <i>Eclogue</i> should only delight, and charm by its
takeing <i>prettiness</i>: All ravishing <i>Delicacies</i> of Thought,
all sweetness of Expression, all that Salt from which <i>Venus</i>, as
the Poets Fable, rose; are so essential to this kind of <i>Poetry</i>,
that it cannot endure any thing that is scurillous, malitiously
biteing, or ridiculous: There must be nothing in it but <i>Hony, Milk,
Roses, Violets</i>, and the like sweetness, so that when you read you
might think that you are in <i>Adonis</i>’s Gardens, as the
<i>Greeks</i> speak, <i>i.e.</i> in the most pleasant place
imaginable: For since the subject of <i>Eclogue</i> must be mean and
unsurprizing, unless it maintains purity and neatness of Expression,
it cannot please.</p>

<p>Therefore it must do as <i>Tully</i> says his friend <i>Atticus</i>
did, who entertaining his acquaintance with Leeks and Onions, pleas’d
them all very well, because he had them serv’d up in wicker Chargers,
and clean Baskets; So let an <i>Eclogue</i> serve up its fruits and
flowers with some, tho no costly imbellishment, such as may answer to
the wicker Chargers, and Baskets; which may be provided at a cheap
rate, and are agreeable to the Country: yet, (and this rule if you aim
at exact simplicity, can never be too nicely observ’d,) you must most
carefully avoid all paint and gawdiness of Expression, and, (which of
all sorts of Elegancies is the most difficult to be avoided) <span
class = "pagenum">44</span> you must take the greatest care that no
scrupulous trimness, or artificial
<ins class = "correction" title = "text reads 'finessess'">fineness</ins> appear:
For, as <i>Quintilian</i> teaches, <i>in some cases diligence and care most
most troublesomly perverse</i>; and when things are most sweet they
are next to loathsome and many times degenerate: Therefore as in
Weomen a careless dress becomes some extreamly. Thus <i>Pastoral</i>,
that it might not be uncomely, ought sometimes to be negligent, or the
finess of its ornaments ought not to appear and lye open to every
bodies view: so that it ought to affect a studied carelessness, and
design’d negligence: And that this may be, all gawdiness of Dress,
such as Paint and Curls, all artificial shining is to be despis’d, but
in the mean time care must be taken that the Expression be bright and
simply clean, not filthy and disgustful, but such as is varnisht with
Wit and Fancy: Now to perfect this, <i>Nature</i> is chiefly to be
lookt upon, (for nothing that is disagreeable to Nature can please)
yet that will hardly prevail naked, by it self, and without the
polishing of Art.</p>

<p>Then there are three things in which, as in its parts, the whole
<i>Character</i> of a <i>Pastoral</i> is contain’d: <i>Simplicity</i>
of Thought and expression: <i>Shortness</i> of Periods full of sense
and spirit: and the <i>Delicacy</i> of a most elegant ravishing
unaffected neatness.</p>

<p>Next I will enquire in to the <i>Efficient</i>, and then into
the <i>Final</i> Cause of <i>Pastorals</i>.</p>

<p><span class = "pagenum">45</span>
<i>Aristotle</i> assigns two efficient Causes of <i>Poetry</i>, The
natural desire of Imitation in Man whom he calls the most imitative
Creature; and Pleasure consequent to that Imitation: Which indeed are
the <i>Remote</i> Causes, but the <i>Immediate</i> are <i>Art</i> and
<i>Nature</i>; Now according to the differences of <i>Genius</i>’s
several <i>Species</i> of Poetry have been introduced. For as the
<i>Philosopher</i> hath observ’d, <span class = "greek">διεσπάθη
κατὰ τὰ οἰκεῖα ἤθη ἡ ποίησις</span> Thus those that were lofty
imitated great and Illustrious; those that were low spirited and
groveling mean Actions: And every one, according to the various
inclination of his <i>Nature</i>, follow’d this or that sort of
<i>Poetry</i>: This the <i>Philosopher</i> expresly affirms, And
<i>Dio Chrysostomus</i> says of <i>Homer</i> that he received from
the Gods a Nature fit for all sorts of Verse: but this is an
happiness which none partake but, as he in the same place intimates,
Godlike minds. </p>

<p>Not to mention other kinds of <i>Poetry</i>, what particular Genius
is requir’d to <i>Pastoral</i> I think, is evident from the foregoing
Discourse, for as every part of it ought to be full of simple and
inartificial neatness, so it requires a Wit naturally neat and
pleasant, born to delight and ravish, which are the qualifications
certainly of a great and most excellent Nature: For whatsoever in any
kind is delicate and elegant, that is usually most excellent: And such
a <i>Genius</i> that hath a sprightfulness of Nature, and is well
instructed <span class = "pagenum">46</span> by the rules of Art, is
fit to attempt <i>Pastorals</i>.</p>

<p>Of the end of Pastorals tis not so easy to give an account: For as
to the end of Poetry in General: The Enemies of Poets run out into a
large common place, and loudly tell us that Poetry is frivolous and
unprofitable. Excellent men! that love <i>profit</i> perchance, but
have no regard for <i>Honesty</i> and <i>Goodness</i>; who do not know
that all excellent <i>Arts</i> sprang from <i>Poetry</i> at first.</p>

<div class = "verse"><i>Which what is honest, base, or just, or good,<br>
Better than</i> Crantor, <i>or</i> Chrysippus <i>show’d</i>.</div>

<p>For tis <i>Poetry</i> that like a chast unspotted Virgin, shews men
the way, and the means to live happily, who afterward are deprav’d by
the immodest precepts of vitiated and impudent <i>Philosophy</i>. For
every body knows, that the <i>Epick</i> sets before us the highest
example of the Bravest man; the <i>Tragedian</i> regulates the
Affections of the Mind; the <i>Lyrick</i> reforms Manners, or sings
the Praises of Gods, and Heroes; so that there’s no part of
<i>Poetry</i> but hath it’s proper end, and profits.</p>

<p>But grant all this true, <i>Pastoral</i> can make no such pretence:
if you sing a <i>Hero</i>, you excite mens minds to imitate his
Actions, and notable Exploits; but how can <i>Bucolicks</i> apply
these or the like advantages to its self? <i>He that reads <span class
= "pagenum">47</span> Heroick Poems, learns what is the vertue of a
Hero, and wishes to be like him; but he that reads Pastorals, neither
learns how to feed sheep, nor wishes himself a shepherd:</i> And a
great deal more to this purpose you may see in <i>Modicius</i>, as
<i>Pontanus</i> cites him in his Notes on <i>Virgil</i>’s
<i>Eclogues</i>.</p>

<p>But when tis the end of <i>Comedy</i>, as <i>Jerom</i> in his
Epistle to <i>Furia</i> says, to know the Humors of Men, and to
describe them; and <i>Demea</i> in <i>Terence</i> intimates the same
thing,</p>

<div class = "verse"><i>To look on all mens lives as in a Glass,<br>
And take from those Examples for our Own</i>,</div>

<p>so that our Humors and Conversations may be better’d, and improv’d;
why may not <i>Pastoral</i> be allow’d the same Priviledge, and be
admitted to regulate and improve a <i>Shepherd</i>’s life by its
<i>Bucolicks</i>? For since tis a product of the Golden Age, it will
shew the most innocent manners of the most ancient Simplicity, how
plain and honest, and how free from all varnish, and deceit, to more
degenerate, and worse times: And certainly for this tis commendable in
its kind, since its design in drawing the image of a Country and
Shepherd’s life, is to teach Honesty, Candor, and Simplicity, which
are the vertues of <i>private</i> men; as <i>Epicks</i> teach the
highest Fortitude, and Prudence, and Conduct, which are the vertues of
<i>Generals</i>, and <i>Kings</i>. And tis ne<span class = "pagenum">48</span>cessary
to Government, that as there is one kind of
<i>Poetry</i> to instruct the <i>Citizens</i>, there should be another
to fashion the manners of the <i>Rusticks</i>: which if
<i>Pastoral</i>, as it does, did not do, yet would it not be
altogether frivolous, and idle, since by its taking prettinesses it
can delight, and please. It can scarce be imagin’d, how much the most
flourishing times of the <i>Roman</i> Common-wealth, in which
<i>Virgil</i> wrote, grew better and brisker by the use of
<i>Pastoral</i>: with it were <i>Augustus</i>, <i>Mecænas</i>,
<i>Asinius Pollio</i>, <i>Alphenus Varus</i>, <i>Cornelius Gallus</i>,
the most admired Wits of that happy Age, wonderfully pleas’d; for
whatever is sweet, and ravishing, is contain’d in this sweetest kind
of Poetry. But if we must slight every thing, from which no
<i>profit</i> is to be hop’d, all pleasures of the Eye and Ear are
presently to be laid aside; and those excellent Arts, <i>Musick</i>,
and <i>Painting</i>, with which the best men use to be delighted, are
presently to be left off. Nor is it indeed credible, that so many
excellent Wits, as have devoted themselves to Poetry, would ever have
medled with it, if it had been so empty, idle, and frivolous, as some
ridiculously morose imagine; who forsooth are better pleas’d with the
severity of <i>Philosophy</i>, and her harsh, deform’d impropriety of
Expressions. But the judgments of such men are the most contemptible
in the world; for when by <i>Poetry</i> mens minds are fashioned to
generous <span class = "pagenum">49</span> Humors, Kindness, and the
like: those must needs be strangers to all those good qualites, who
hate, or proclaim <i>Poetry</i> to be frivolous, and useless.</p>

<i>Rules for writing</i> Pastorals.</p>

<p><span class = "firstletter">I</span>N delivering Rules for writing
<i>Pastorals</i>, I shall not point to the <i>streams</i>, which to
look after argues a small creeping <i>Genius</i>, but lead you to the
<i>fountains</i>. But first I must tell you, how difficult it is to
write <i>Pastorals</i>, which many seem not sufficiently to
understand: For since its matter is low, and humble, it seems to have
nothing that is troublesome, and difficult. But this is a great
mistake, for, as <i>Horace</i> says of <i>Comedy</i>, "It is by so
much the more difficult, by how much the less pardonable are the
mistakes committed in its composure": and the same is to be thought of
every thing, whose end is to please, and delight. For whatsoever is
contriv’d for pleasure, and not necessarily requir’d, unless it be
exquisite, must be nauseous, and distastful; as at a Supper, scraping
Musick, thick Oyntment, or the like, because the Entertainment might
have been without all these; For the sweetest things, and most
delicious, are most apt to satiate; for tho the sense may sometimes be
pleas’d, yet it presently disgusts that which is <span class = "pagenum">51</span>
luscious, and, as <i>Lucretius</i> phraseth
it,</p>

<div class = "verse"><i>E’en in the midst and fury of the Joys,<br>
Some thing that’s better riseth, and destroys</i>.</div>

<p>Beside, since <i>Pastoral</i> is of that nature, that it cannot
endure too much negligence, nor too scrupulous diligence, it must be
very difficult to be compos’d, especially since the expression must be
neat, but not too exquisite, and fine: It must have a simple native
beauty, but not too mean; it must have all sorts of delicacies, and
surprizing fancies, yet not be flowing, and luxuriant. And certainly,
to hit all these excellencies is difficult enough, since Wit, whose
nature it is to pour it self forth, must rather be restrain’d than
indulg’d; and that force of the Mind, which of it self is so ready to
run on, must be checkt, and bridled: Which cannot be easily perform’d
by any, but those who have a very good Judgment, and practically
skill’d in Arts, and Sciences: And lastly, a neat, and as it were a
happy Wit; not that curious sort, I mean, which <i>Petronius</i>
allows <i>Horace</i>, lest too much <i>Art</i> should take off the
Beauty of the <i>Simplicity</i>. And therefore I would not have any
one undertake this task, that is not very polite by <i>Nature</i>, and
very much at leisure. For what is more hard than to be always in the
<i>Country</i>, and yet never to be <i>Clownish</i>? to sing of
<i>mean</i>, and <i>trivial</i> mat<span class = "pagenum">52</span>ters,
yet not <i>trivially</i>, and <i>meanly</i>?
to pipe on a <i>slender</i> Reed, and yet keep the sound from being
<i>harsh</i>, and <i>squeaking</i>? to make every thing <i>sweet</i>,
yet never <i>satiate</i>? And this I thought necessary to premise, in
order to the better laying down of such Rules as I design. For the
naked <i>simplicity</i> both of the Matter and Expression of a
<i>Pastoral</i>, upon bare Contemplation, might seem easily to be hit,
but upon trial ’twill be found a very hard task: Nor was the
difficulty to be dissembled, lest <i>Ignorance</i> should betray some
into a rash attempt. Now I must come to the very Rules; for as nothing
excellent can be brought to perfection without <i>Nature</i>, (for Art
unassisted by that, is vain, and ineffectual,) so there is no
<i>Nature</i> so excellent, and happy, which by its own strength, and
without <i>Art</i> and <i>Use</i> can make any thing excellent, and
great.</p>

<p>But tis hard to give <i>Rules</i> for that, for which there have
been none already given; for where there are no footsteps nor path to
direct, I cannot tell how any one can be certain of his way. Yet in
this difficulty I will follow <i>Aristotle</i>’s Example, who being to
lay down Rules concerning <i>Epicks</i>, propos’d <i>Homer</i> as a
Pattern, from whom he deduc’d the whole Art: So I will gather from
<i>Theocritus</i> and <i>Virgil</i>, those Fathers of <i>Pastoral</i>,
what I shall deliver on this account. For all the Rules that are to be
given of any Art, are to be given of it as excellent, and perfect, and
<span class = "pagenum">53</span> therefore ought to be taken from
them in whom it is so.</p>

<p>The first Rule shall be about the <i>Matter</i>, which is either
the <i>Action</i> of a <i>Shepherd</i>, or contriv’d and fitted to the
<i>Genius</i> of a Shepherd; for tho <i>Pastoral</i> is simple, and
bashful, yet it will entertain lofty subjects, if it can be permitted
to turn and fashion them to its own proper Circumstances, and Humor:
which tho <i>Theocritus</i> hath never done, but kept close to
<i>pastoral</i> simplicity, yet <i>Virgil</i> hath happily attempted;
of whom almost the same <i>Character</i> might be given, which
<i>Quintilian</i> bestow’d on <i>Stesichorus</i>, who <i>with his Harp
bore up the most weighty subjects of</i> Epick <i>Poetry</i>; for
<i>Virgil</i> sang great and lofty things to his Oaten Reed, but yet
suited to the Humor of a Shepherd, for every thing that is not
agreeable to that, cannot belong to <i>Pastoral</i>: of its own nature
it cannot treat of lofty and great matters.</p>

<p>Therefore let <i>Pastoral</i> be smooth and soft, not noisy and
bombast; lest whilst it raiseth its voice, and opens its mouth, it
meet with the same fate that, they say, an <i>Italian</i> Shepherd
did, who having a very large mouth, and a very strong breath, brake
his Pipe as often as he blow’d it. This is a great fault in one that
writes <i>Pastorals</i>: for if his words are too sounding, or his
sense too strong, he must be absurd, because indecently loud. And this
is not the rule of an unskilful <span class = "pagenum">54</span>
impertinent Adviser, but rather of a very excellent Master in this
<i>Art</i>; for <i>Phoebus</i> twitcht <i>Virgil</i> by the Ear, and
warn’d him to forbear great Subjects: but if it ventures upon such, it
may be allow’d to use some short <i>Invocations</i>, and, as
<i>Epicks</i> do, modestly implore the assistance of a Muse. This
<i>Virgil</i> doth in his <i>Pollio</i>, which is a Composure of an
unusual loftiness:</p>

<div class = "verse">Sicilian <i>Muse begin a loftier strain</i>.</div>

<p>So he invocates <i>Arethusa</i>, when <i>Cornelius Gallus
Proconsul of Ægypt</i> and his <i>Amours</i>, matters above the
common reach of <i>Pastoral</i>, are his Subject.</p>

<div class = "verse"><i>One Labor more O</i> Arethusa <i>yield.</i></div>

<p>Why he makes his application to <i>Aretheusa</i> is easy to
conjecture, for she was a <i>Nymph</i> of <i>Sicily</i>, and so he
might hope that she could inspire him with a <i>Genius</i> fit for
<i>Pastorals</i> which first began in that <i>Island</i>, Thus in the
seventh and eighth <i>Eclogue</i>, as the matter would bear, he
invocates the Nymphs and Muses: And <i>Theocritus</i> does the
same,</p>

<div class = "verse"><i>Tell Goddess, you can tell</i>.</div>

<p>From whence ’tis evident that in <i>Pastoral</i>, tho it never
pretends to any greatness, <i>Invocations</i> <span class = "pagenum">55</span>
may be allow’d: But whatever Subject it chooseth,
it must take care to accommodate it to the Genius and Circumstances of
a Shepherd.

Concerning the Form, or mode of <i>Imitation</i>, I shall not repeat
what I have already said, <i>viz.</i> that this is in it self
<i>mixt</i>; for <i>Pastoral</i> is either <i>Alternate</i>, or hath
but <i>one Person</i>, or is <i>mixt</i> of both: yet ’tis properly
and chiefly <i>Alternate</i>. as is evident from that of
<i>Theocritus</i>.</p>

<div class = "verse"><i>Sing</i> Rural <i>strains, for as we march along<br>
We may delight each other with a Song</i>.</div>

<p>In which the <i>Poet</i> shows that <i>alternate</i> singing is
proper to a <i>Pastoral</i>: But as for the <i>Fable</i>, ’tis
requisite that it should be simple, lest in stead of <i>Pastoral</i>
it put on the form of a <i>Comedy</i>, or <i>Tragedy</i> if the
<i>Fable</i> be great, or intricate: It must be <i>One</i>; this
<i>Aristotle</i> thinks necessary in every <i>Poem</i>, and
<i>Horace</i> lays down this general Rule,</p>

<div class = "verse"><i>Be every</i> Fable <i>simple, and but one</i>:</div>

<p>For every Poem, that is not <i>One</i>, is imperfect, and this
<i>Unity</i> is to be taken from the <i>Action</i>: for if that is
<i>One</i>, the Poem will be so too. Such is the Passion of
<i>Corydon</i> in <i>Virgil</i>’s second Eclogue, <i>Melibœus’s</i>
Expostulation with <i>Tityrus</i> about his Fortune;
<i>Theocritus</i>’s <i>Thyrsis, Cyclops</i>, and <i>Amaryllis</i>, of
which perhaps in its proper place I may treat more largely.

<span class = "pagenum">56</span>
Let the third Rule be concerning the <i>Expression</i>, which cannot
be in this kind excellent unless borrow’d from <i>Theocritus</i>’s
<i>Idylliums</i>, or <i>Virgil</i>’s <i>Eclogues</i>, let it be
chiefly simple, and ingenuous: such is that of <i>Theocritus</i>,</p>

<div class = "verse"><i>A Kid belongs to thee, and Kids are good</i>,</div>

<p>Or that in <i>Virgil</i>’s seventh Eclogue,</p>

<div class = "verse"><i>This Pail of Milk, these Cakes</i> (Priapus) <i>every year<br>
Expect; a little Garden is thy care:<br>
Thou’rt Marble now, but if more Land I hold,<br>
If my Flock thrive, thou shalt be made of Gold</i>,</div>

<p>than which I cannot imagine more simple, and more ingenuous
expressions. To which may be added that out of his <i>Palemon</i>,</p>

<div class = "verse"><i>And I love</i> Phyllis, <i>for her Charms excell;<br>
At my departure O what tears there fell!<br>
She sigh’d, Farewell Dear Youth, a long Farewell</i>.</div>

<p>Now, That I call an ingenuous Expression which is clear and smooth,
that swells with no insolent words, or bold metaphors, but hath
something familiar, and as it were obvious in its Composure, and not
disguis’d by any study’d and affected dress: All its Ornament must be
like the Corn and fruits in the Country, easy to <span class =
"pagenum">57</span> be gotten, and ready at hand, not such as requires
Care, Labor, and Cost to be obtain’d: as <i>Hermogenes</i> on
<i>Theocritus</i> observes; <i>See how easie and unaffected this
sounds</i>,</p>

<div class = "verse"><i>Pines murmurings, Goatherd, are a pleasing sound</i>,</div>

<p><i>and most of his expressions, not to say all, are of the same
nature</i>: for the ingenuous simplicity both of Thought and
Expression is the natural <i>Characteristick</i> of <i>Pastoral</i>.
In this <i>Theocritus</i> and <i>Virgil</i> are admirable, and
excellent, the others despicable, and to be pittied; for they being
enfeebled by the meanes of their subject, either creep, or fall flat.
<i>Virgil</i> keeps himself up by his choice and curious words, and
tho his matter for the most part (and <i>Pastoral</i> requires it) is
mean, yet his expressions never flag, as is evident from these lines
in his <i>Alexis</i>:</p>

<div class = "verse"><i>The glossy Plums I’le bring, and juicy Pear,<br>
Such as were once delightful to my Dear:<br>
I’le crop the Laurel, and the Myrtle tree,<br>
Confus’dly set, because their Sweets agree</i>.</div>

<p>For since the matter must be low, to avoid being abject, and
despicable, you must borrow some light from the Expression; not such
as is dazling, but pure, and lambent, such as may shine thro the whole
matter, but never flash, and blind. <span class = "pagenum">58</span>
The words of such a <i>Stile</i> we are usually taught in our Nurses
armes, but ’tis to be perfected and polished by length of time,
frequent use, study, and diligent reading of the most approved
Authors: for Pastoral is apt to be slighted for the meaness of its
Matter, unless it hath some additional Beauty, be pure, polisht, and
so made pleasing, and attractive. Therefore never let any one, that
designs to write <i>Pastorals</i>, corrupt himself with foreign
manners; for if he hath once vitiated the healthful habit, as I may
say, of Expression, which <i>Bucolicks</i> necessarily require, ’tis
impossible he should be fit for that task. Yet let him not affect
pompous or dazling Expressions, for such belong to <i>Epicks</i>, or
<i>Tragedians</i>. Let his words sometimes tast of the Country, not
that I mean, of which <i>Volusius</i>’s Annals, upon which
<i>Catullus</i> hath made that biting <i>Epigram</i>, are full; for
though the Thought ought to be rustick, and such as is suitable to a
Shepherd, yet it ought not to be Clownish, as is evident in
<i>Corydon</i>, when he makes mention of his Goats.</p>

<div class = "verse"><i>Young sportive Creatures, and of spotted hue,<br>
Which suckled twice a day, I keep for you:<br>
These</i> Thestilis <i>hath beg’d, and beg’d in vain,<br>
But now they’re Hers, since You my Gifts disdain</i>.</div>

<p>For what can be more Rustical, than to design those <i>Goats</i>
for <i>Alexis</i>, at that very time when <span class = "pagenum">59</span>
he believes <i>Thestylis’s</i> winning importunity
will be able to prevail? yet there is nothing Clownish in the words.
In short, <i>Bucolicks</i> should deserve that commendation which
<i>Tully</i> gives <i>Crassus</i>, of whose Orations he would say,
<i>that nothing could be more free from childish painting, and
affected finery</i>. So let the Expression in <i>Pastoral</i> be
without gawdy trappings, and all those little fineries of Art, which
are us’d to set off and varnish a discourse: But let an ingenuous
Simplicity. and unaffected pleasing Neatness appear in every part;
which yet will be flat, if ’t is drawn out to any length, if not close,
short, and broken, as that in <i>Virgil</i>,</p>

<div class = "verse"><i>He that loves</i> Bavius <i>Verses, hates not Thine</i>:</div>

<p>And in the same <i>Eclogue</i>,</p>

<div class = "verse">&nbsp; <i>—It is not safe to drive too nigh,<br>
The Bank may fail, the Ram is hardly dry</i>:</div>

<p>And in <i>Corydon</i>,</p>

<div class = "verse"><i>To learn this Art what won’t</i> Amyntas <i>do</i>?</div>

<p>
And in <i>Theocritus</i> much of the same nature may be seen; as in
his other <i>Pastoral Idylliums</i>, so chiefly in his fifth. Thus
<i>Battus</i> in the fourth <i>Idyllium</i>, complaining for the
loss of <i>Amaryllis</i>,
<span class = "pagenum">60</span></p>

<div class = "verse"><i>Dear Nymph, dear as my Goats, you dy’d</i>.</div>

<p>And how soft and tender is that in the third <i>Idyllium</i>,</p>

<div class = "verse"><i>And she may look on me, she may be won,<br>
She may be kind, she is not perfect Stone</i>,</div>

<p>And in this <i>concise</i>, close way of Expression lies the
chiefest Grace of <i>Pastorals</i>: for in my opinion there’s nothing
in the whole Composition that can delight more than those frequent
stops, and breakings off. Yet lest in these too it become dull and
sluggish, it must be quickned by frequent lively touches of
Concernment: such as that of the Goatherd in the third Idyllium,</p>

<div class = "verse"><i>—I see that I must die</i>:</div>

<p>Or <i>Daphnis</i>’s despair, which <i>Thyrsis</i> sings in the
first <i>Idyllium</i>,</p>

<div class = "verse"><i>Ye Wolves, and Pards, and Mountain Bores adieu,<br>
The Herdsmen now must walk no more with You</i>.</div>

<p>How tender are the lines, and yet what passion they contain! And
most of <i>Virgil</i>’s are of this nature, but there are likewise
in him some touches of despairing Love, such as is this of
<i>Alphesibœus</i>,</p>

<div class = "verse"><i>Nor have I any mind to be reliev’d</i>:</div>

<p><span class = "pagenum">61</span>Or that of <i>Damon</i>,</p>

<div class = "verse"><i>I’le dy, yet tell my Love e’en whilst I dy</i>:</div>

<p>Or that of <i>Corydon</i>,</p>

<div class = "verse"><i>He lov’d, but could not hope for Love again</i>.</div>

<p>For tho <i>Pastoral</i> doth not admit any violent passions, such
as proceed from the greatest extremity, and usually accompany despair;
yet because Despairing Love is not attended with those frightful and
horrible consequences, but looks more like <i>grief to be pittied</i>,
and a <i>pleasing madness</i>, than <i>rage</i> and <i>fury</i>,
<i>Eclogue</i> is so far from refusing, that it rather loves, and
passionately requires them. Therefore an unfortunate <i>Shepherd</i>
may be brought in, complaining of his successless Love to the <i>Moon,
Stars</i>, or <i>Rocks</i>, or to the Woods, and purling Streams,
mourning the unsupportable anger, the frowns and coyness of his proud
<i>Phyllis</i>; singing at his <i>Nymphs</i> door, (which
<i>Plutarch</i> reckons among the signs of Passion) or doing any of
those fooleries, which are familiar to Lovers. Yet the Passion must
not rise too high, as <i>Polyphemus</i>’s, <i>Galateas’s</i> mad
Lover, of whom <i>Theocritus</i> divinely thus, as almost of every
thing else:</p>

<div class = "verse"><i>His was no common flame, nor could he move<br>
In the old Arts, and beaten paths of Love,<br>
No Flowers nor Fruits sent to oblige the Fair,<br>
His was all Rage, and Madness</i>:</div><span class = "pagenum">62</span>

<p>For all violent Perturbations are to be diligently avoided by
<i>Bucolicks</i>, whose nature it is to be <i>soft</i>, and
<i>easie</i>: For in small matters, and such must all the strifes and
contentions of Shepherds be, to make a great deal of adoe, is as
unseemly, as to put <i>Hercules’s</i> Vizard and Buskins on an Infant,
as <i>Quintilian</i> hath excellently observ’d. For since
<i>Eclogue</i> is but weak, it seems not capable of those Commotions
which belong to the <i>Theater</i>, and <i>Pulpit</i>; they must be
soft, and gentle, and all its Passion must seem to flow only, and not
break out: as in <i>Virgil’s Gallus</i>,</p>

<div class = "verse"><i>Ah, far from home and me You wander o’re<br>
The</i> Alpine <i>snows, the farthest Western shore,<br>
And frozen</i> Rhine. <i>When are we like to meet?<br>
Ah gently, gently, lest thy tender feet<br>
Sharp Ice may wound</i>.</div>

<p>To these he may sometimes joyn some short Interrogations made
to <i>inanimate Beings</i>, for those spread a strange life and
vigor thro the whole Composure. Thus in <i>Daphnis</i>,</p>

<div class = "verse"><i>Did not You Streams, and Hazels, hear the Nymphs</i>?</div>

<p>Or give the very Trees, and Fountains sense, as in <i>Tityrus</i>,</p>

<div class = "verse"><i>Thee</i> (Tityrus) <i>the Pines, and every Vale,<br>
The Fountains, Hills, and every shrub did call</i>:</div>

<p>for by this the Concernment is express’d; and of the like nature
is that of <i>Thyrsis</i>, in <i>Virgil</i>’s <i>Melibœus</i>,
<span class = "pagenum">63</span></p>

<div class = "verse"><i>When</i> Phyllis <i>comes, my wood will all be green</i>.</div>

<p>And this sort of Expressions is frequent in <i>Theocritus</i>, and
<i>Virgil</i>, and in these the delicacy of <i>Pastoral</i> is
principally contain’d, as one of the old <i>Interpreters</i> of
<i>Theocritus</i> hath observ’d on this line, in the eighth
<i>Idyllium</i>,</p>

<div class = "verse"><i>Ye Vales, and Streams, a race Divine</i>:</div>

<p>But let them be so, and so seldom us’d, that nothing appear
vehement, and bold, for Boldness and Vehemence destroy the sweetness
which peculiarly commends <i>Bucolicks</i>, and in those Composures a
constant care to be soft and easie should be chief: For
<i>Pastoral</i> bears some resemblance to <i>Terence</i>, of whom
<i>Tully</i>, in that Poem which he writes to <i>Libo</i>, gives this
Character,</p>

<div class = "verse"><i>His words are soft, and each expression sweet</i>.</div>

<p>In mixing <i>Passion</i> in <i>Pastorals</i>, that rule of
<i>Longinus</i>, in his golden Treatise <span class = "greek">περὶ ὕψους</span>,
must be observ’d, <i>Never use it, but when the matter requires it,
and then too very sparingly</i>.

Concerning the <i>Numbers</i>, in which <i>Pastoral</i> should be
written, this is my opinion; the <i>Heroick</i> Measure, but not so
strong and sounding as in <i>Epicks</i>, is to be chosen.
<i>Virgil</i> and <i>Theocritus</i> have given us examples; for tho
<i>Theocritus</i> hath in one Idyllium mixt other Numbers, yet that
can be of no force against all the rest; and <i>Virgil</i> useth no
Numbers but <i>Heroick</i>, from whence it may be inferr’d, that those
are the fittest.

<span class = "pagenum">64</span>
<i>Pastoral</i> may sometimes admit plain, but not long
<i>Narrations</i> such as <i>Socrates</i> in <i>Plato</i> requires in
a Poet; for he chiefly approves those who use a plain
<i>Narration</i>, and commends that above all other which is short,
and fitly expresseth the nature of the Thing. Some are of opinion that
<i>Bucolicks</i> cannot endure Narrations, especially if they are very
long, and imagine there are none in <i>Virgil</i>: but they have not
been nice enough in their observations, for there are some, as that in
<i>Silenus</i>.</p>

<div class = "verse"><i>Young</i> Chromis <i>and</i> Mnasylus <i>chanct to stray,<br>
Where (sleeping in a Cave)</i> Silenus <i>lay,<br>
Whose constant Cups fly fuming to his brain,<br>
And always boyl in each extended vein:<br>
His trusty Flaggon, full of potent Juice,<br>
Was hanging by, worn out with Age, and Use, &amp;c.</i></div>

<p>But, because <i>Narrations</i> are so seldom to be found in
<i>Theocritus</i>, and <i>Virgil</i>, I think they ought not to be
often us’d; yet if the matter will bear it, I believe such as
<i>Socrates</i> would have, may very fitly be made use of.

The Composure will be more suitable to the Genius of a Shepherd, if
now and then there are some short turns and digressions from the
purpose: Such is that concerning <i>Pasiphae</i> in <i>Silenus</i>,
although tis almost too long; but we may give
<i><ins class = "correction" title = "text reads 'Viogil'">Virgil</ins></i>
a little leave, who takes so little liberty himself.

<span class = "pagenum">65</span>
Concerning <i>Descriptions</i> I cannot tell what to lay down, for in
this matter our Guides, <i>Virgil</i>, and <i>Theocritus</i>, do not
very well agree. For he in his first <i>Idyllium</i> makes such a long
immoderate description of his <i>Cup</i>, that <i>Criticks</i> find
fault with him, but no such description appears in all <i>Virgil</i>;
for how sparing is he in his description of <i>Melibœus</i>’s Beechen
Pot, the work of Divine <i>Alcimedon</i>? He doth it in <i>five</i>
verses, <i>Theocritus</i> runs out into <i>thirty</i>, which certainly
is an argument of a wit that is very much at leisure, and unable to
moderate his force. That <i>shortness</i> which <i>Virgil</i> hath
prudently made choice of, is in my opinion much better; for a
Shepherd, who is naturally incurious, and unobserving, cannot think
that tis his duty to be exact in particulars, and describe every thing
with an accurate niceness: yet <i>Roncardus</i> hath done it, a man of
most correct judgment, and, in imitation of <i>Theocritus</i>, hath,
considering the then poverty of our language, admirably and largely
describ’d <i>his</i> Cup; and <i>Marinus</i> in his Idylliums hath
follow’d the same example. He never keeps within compass in his
Descriptions, for which he is deservedly blam’d; let those who would
be thought accurate, and men of judgment, follow <i>Virgil</i>’s
prudent moderation. Nor can the Others gain any advantage from
<i>Moschus</i>’s <i>Europa</i>, in which the description of the
<i>Basket</i> is very long, for that Idyllium is not <i>Pastoral</i>;
yet I confess, that some <span class = "pagenum">66</span>
descriptions of such trivial things, if not minutely accurate, may, if
seldom us’d, be decently allow’d a place in the discourses of
<i>Shepherds</i>.</p>

<p>But tho you must be sparing in your <i>Descriptions</i>, yet your
<i>Comparisons</i> must be frequent, and the more often you use them,
the better and more graceful will be the Composure; especially if
taken from such things, as the Shepherds must be familiarly acquainted
with: They are frequent in <i>Theocritus</i> but so proper to the
Country, that none but a <i>Shepherd</i> dare use them. Thus
<i>Menalcas</i> in the eighth Idyllium: </p>

<div class = "verse"><i>Rough Storms to Trees, to Birds the treacherous Snare,<br>
Are frightful Evils; Springes to the Hare,<br>
Soft Virgins Love to Man, &amp;c.</i></div>

<p>And <i>Damœtas</i> in <i>Virgil</i>’s <i>Palæmon</i>,</p>

<div class = "verse"><i>Woolves sheep destroy, Winds Trees when newly blown,<br>
Storms Corn, and me my</i> Amaryllis <i>frown</i>.</div>

<p>And that in the eighth <i>Eclogue</i>,</p>

<div class = "verse"><i>As Clay grows hard, Wax soft in the same fire,<br>
So</i> Daphnis <i>does in one extream desire.</i></div>

<p>And such <i>Comparisons</i> are very frequent in him, and very
suitable to the Genius of a Shepherd; as likewise often
<i>repetitions</i>, and doublings of some words: which, if they are
luckily plac’d have an unexpressible quaintness, and make the Numbers
extream sweet, and the turns ravishing and delightful. An instance of
this we have in <i>Virgil</i>’s <i>Melibœus</i>,</p>

<div class = "verse">Phyllis <i>the Hazel loves; whilst</i> Phyllis <i>loves that Tree,<br>
Myrtles than Hazels of less fame shall be</i>.</div><span class = "pagenum">67</span>

<p>As for the <i>Manners</i> of your <i>Shepherds</i>, they must be
such as theirs who liv’d in the Islands of the Happy or Golden Age:
They must be candid, simple, and ingenuous; lovers of Goodness, and
Justice, affable, and kind; strangers to all fraud, contrivance, and
deceit; in their Love modest, and chast, not one suspitious word, no
loose expression to be allowed: and in this part <i>Theocritus</i> is
faulty, <i>Virgil</i> never; and this difference perhaps is to be
ascrib’d to their Ages, the times in which the latter liv’d being more
polite, civil, and gentile. And therefore those who make wanton Love-
stories the subject of Pastorals, are in my opinion very unadvis’d;
for all sort of lewdness or debauchery are directly contrary to the
<i>Innocence</i> of the <i>golden</i> Age. There is another thing in
which <i>Theocritus</i> is faulty, and that is making his Shepherds
too sharp, and abusive to one another; <i>Comatas</i> and <i>Lacon</i>
are ready to fight, and the railing between those two is as bitter as
<i>Billingsgate</i>: Now certainly such Raillery cannot be suitable to
those sedate times of the Happy Age.</p>

<p>As for <i>Sentences</i>, if weighty, and Philosophical, common
Sense tells us they are not fit for a <i>Shepherd</i>’s mouth. Here
<i>Theocritus</i> cannot be altogether excus’d, but <i>Virgil</i>
deserves no reprehension. But <i>Proverbs</i> justly challenge
admission into <i>Pastorals</i>, nothing being more common in <span
class = "pagenum">68</span> the mouths of Countrymen than old
Sayings.</p>

<p>Thus much seem’d necessary to be premis’d out of <i>RAPIN</i>, for
the direction and information of the Reader.</p>

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
